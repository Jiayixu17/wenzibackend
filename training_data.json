    "data": "\"Do I look man enough?\" As someone whose body falls outside the societal ideal, I have struggled to establish a positive body image. Skinny, lithe, and lean, my body might fit the mold of a long-distance runner, but one would hardly consider it stereotypically masculine. One might even say it's feminine. And if there's one thing men are taught to reject, it is femininity. I have spent years painstakingly overanalyzing nutrition and exercise and appearance, trying to decipher whether my body was a body I wanted, a body I felt proud of. I've tried to balance my daily miles with my daily calorie intake, a strong lower body with a comparatively weaker upper body. My exercise accomplishments --hikes, long runs, marathons, personal records--can sometimes feel less valuable when I consider my frame. While trying to make sense of my body, I've grappled with the rigid definitions of masculinity and femininity: what constitutes a \"good\" body versus a \"bad\" body? The construction of these illusive categories show deep-rooted problems in the way society understands health, gender, and individual expression. In the United States, the ideal male body is muscular, athletic, formidable, and toned. I don't have bulging or sculpted muscles. I'm not tall or broad-shouldered. And for so long I focused on how my body failed to meet standards instead of defining my own terms for body satisfaction. My time at college is marked by small steps forward in my journey towards establishing healthy body image. It has involved coming to terms with the ways in which my body does not meet the dominant standards of masculinity. This progress is largely due to students and faculty initiating conversations and posing important questions aboutbody image and campus cultureatBoston Collegeand other campuses across the country. While exploring my body image, I have grappled with questions like: \"Do I look man enough?\" \"Do I look masculine?\" \"Do I have a good body?\" \"What is a good body anyway?\" What I've come to value--and what has helped so much--is having space to explore these questions with others, whether in class, at a lecture, or in a friend's living room. So many people are exploring these questions! June wasMen's Health Month, and advocates across the countrycreated space for discussing issueslike preventive health and mental health. After long being solely cast as women's health issues, body image and body satisfaction have become increasingly vital topics in men's health as well. For instance, duringLove Your Body Week at Boston College, there is always an event that addresses issues of masculinity and body image. This chiseled ideal of masculinity narrows the range of male bodies deemed acceptable, attractive, or desirable and casts an impossible mold for men and boys. If you deviate too far from that standard, you might just feel out of place. For example, restricting the ideal body to an impossible healthy and muscular standard has produced an unhealthy culture ofworkout supplements and bodybuilding. The body is often a source of concern and dissatisfaction, and this kind of scrutiny can have debilitating consequences for mental and physical health, as inBody Dysmorphic Disorder and Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder. Stories about body imageare necessary because they reveal the cracks in the impossible model of embodied masculinity. Even starting these conversations can be difficult because stereotypical masculinity dictates that we show unwavering confidence in the face of adversity, that we hide vulnerability. Instead of engaging honestly and critically, we keep quiet. Against the odds, while in college, I began to embrace my own body and celebrate the remarkable and beautiful diversity of all bodies. At college, we're encouraged to examine the way our bodies affect our relationships with friends, classmates, partners, mentors, and professional connections. What's less talked about is how this obsession with idealized bodies affects our relationships with ourselves. Taking part in the campus conversations about body image and learning to celebrate difference provided the momentum I needed to move forward. I had many difficult days and experiences, like runs not intended to celebrate my body but to punish it, restrictive eating habits, and experimenting with protein supplements. But I've come to focus less on how my body looks, and more on what it can do. I might have a slight frame, but my accomplishments are sizeable. I've raced two marathons and run countless miles. I've hiked difficult trails, culminating in the most spectacular views. I've become an adventurous eater, and I've embraced food as nourishment and cooking as an opportunity for building connections with friends and family. Taking a holistic approach to body image--realizing that I am more than my body as much as I am my body--has helped me recognize the value and worth of my own frame. Instead of focusing on the stereotypically masculine features I don't have, I focus on what I do have: an agile body that supports my everyday activities, an efficient and powerful stride that powers my long distance running. I'm only one man, but this body is man enough for me.

    "data": "By Estela Lugo Watch Estela perform her story livehere. 1996 Dammit...dammit...dammit! My panic echoed off the chocolate marble vanity, bouncing off its shiny gold fixtures and into a rising pile of lemon-scented suds. It had only been 2 short days since I had convinced my father to reluctantly pay a whopping $80 for a brand-new tuxedo. I wasn't sure what hurt more now, the fact that I had wasted his hard-earned money or the sharp and familiar stings of humiliation and failure. The platter-sized stain looked even bigger now in the wall to wall mirrors. Even through my blurry tears, I could see it staring back with scathing judgement. \"What the hell were you thinking? A waitress, really? I continued scrubbing through the layers of stubborn marinara sauce, praying that no one from the staff or wedding party would walk in to find a defeated, and disabled teenager experiencing one of the most humiliating moments of her life. How in the world was I ever going to have a job with this stupid disease? I could still see the look of concern on the guests' faces from earlier that evening. One woman had even declined my offer to pour her tea after noticing my uneasy grip on the pot handle. In concern for her own safety, she insisted on pouring it herself while throwing me a look that clearly stated \"Girlfriend, you are not coming near me with that pot of burning hot water\" And she was completely right. I had no business thinking that I could be a waitress. Not with these clumsy hands and hazardous feet. I was a danger to myself and now I was a danger to others. I wish I could say there was a time in my life when I felt \"normal\", but there really isn't. Some of my first memories include sitting on the number rug in my Kindergarten class and showing off my new plastic leg braces to friends. I mean, it didn't really seem to bother me back then. But as the years passed by, my confidence took on more and more hits. I was in 3rd grade now and needed a runner for softball. I was getting tagged out way more than anyone else on the team and my mom had finally decided to talk to my coaches. Easy fly balls were dropping right through my mit...and as much as my poor parents tried to oil, stretch and wear down that leather, it still felt like concrete everytime I put it on. My most recent dance recital had been more stressful than exciting. I could only stay up on my tippy toes for 2 or 3 seconds now before my ankles gave way and dropped me back to my feet. So at the ripe old age of 8, I hung up my ballet slippers and retired. 2 years later, my cleats and mitt joined them in hopes that one day, I'd find my \"thing\". But despite the regular moments of disappointment, life was still pretty damn good. I had two incredible Puerto Rican parents whose lives and hearts revolved around me and my younger sister, Melissa. Despite not having any family history, Miguel & Eneida had been dealt powerball odds of having, not one, but both of their daughter's diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth, also known as CMT, before the age of 4. All they had been told by the doctors was that their daughter's hands and feet would progressively weaken over time and that there was no treatments or cure. Where many families could have fallen victim to shame, self pity and despair, my incredible parents decided to become overnight advocates. 1987 \"I sent your photo to some people the other day\" my mom said as she brushed my hair into a tight ponytail. \"They want you to be the poster child for Long Island\" \"Mooommm, what? What does that mean, a poster child? \"They want us to take photos at their events and help them raise money for a cure.\" Now, I don't remember formally agreeing to this poster child thing, but I do remember that soon after that conversation, my family's life was forever changed. Every weekend, between 1987 and 1992, involved us traveling to some kind of fundraising event, sometimes even 2 or 3 in one weekend. And it wasn't just taking pictures either, we were speaking in front of crowds of people, being interviewed on local news channels, meeting celebrities like Sammy Davis Jr. and Ron Darling. Sometimes we'd even put on impromptu lip-syncing performances at high school dance-a-thons (did I mention this was the 80s?). They were some of the greatest years of our lives. One of the best parts of it all was the healing it provided for our family. Advocacy had quite literally turned my parents' pain into purpose while also building up my sister and I's confidence. We were exposed to a world of passionate, generous and caring people. We grew up experiencing the importance of volunteer work, service and community. And we developed a deep sense of humility and gratitude for the challenges we did have because we now personally knew many families whose daily battles dwarfed our own. But like all good things, they must come to an end. Melissa and I eventually aged out of our poster child status and into tweens with social lives. My parents still ran the local volunteer chapter as well as the annual telethon call center. Mom went back to working full-time and life was just busier. 1992 \"Am I really not going to have to wear braces anymore?\" I had anxiously asked this same question during every appointment for the past year, terrified of hearing a different answer.\"I don't see why not, kiddo. You'll have all the support you need after we straighten you out.\" Dr. Gruber said in his warm NY accent, reaching into his white coat pocket and pulling out a voice recorder to document his latest observations. He was a well-respected and kind surgeon with a full head of salt and pepper hair who never had less than 3 or 4 med students parading behind him, in and out of every room. He'd poke at my motionless and twisted feet inviting them to take a closer look while he used big words like atrophy and dorsiflexion. It was early June of 6th grade when both of my leg casts were finally cut off. It had been 12 long and painful weeks of recovery. For the first 6 of those, the rigid white plaster had wrapped all the way up my thighs, stopping only a few inches from where my New Kids on the Block underwear started. This made showering and bathroom time loads of fun. For almost 2 months, my day mainly consisted of being carried from my bed to the bathroom and back to the bed. One weekend, we got hit with a nor'easter. My parents bundled me up as best they could, layering blankets over my legs and open toes before wheeling me outside onto the freshly shoveled walkway. My dad positioned me right up against the base of our snowman, handing me fistfulls of packed snow to slap onto the torso. I laughed as my sister did her ridiculous Christmas Story impression... falling back into the snow and flailing her arms as she attempted to get back up. By Easter, I was using crutches to get around. It felt good to be vertical again. The air was blooming with new possibilities and it felt energizing to know the most difficult days were now behind me. Dr. Gruber had successfully fused and straightened my floppy, crooked feet into a 90-degree angle just as promised. My new mission that summer was to learn to walk again in time for my first day of Junior High School. I had already begun clipping out back-to-school looks from my Teen Magazines; plaid skirts and grungy floral dresses...you know, the kind that Drew Barrymore and Courtney Love wore-- complete with white tees and shiny Doc Martin boots. No more braces meant, I could finally bear my legs without feeling like some kind of freak...I would finally fit in. 1993 The bell rang for home economics class. \"Shit\" I mumbled under my breath as I scurried faster past the cafeteria. I was going to be late again. The halls were now empty except for a few of the 'bad kids' loudly and obnoxiously trailing behind me. They were the school misfits, regularly getting kicked out of class for talking back to teachers and causing chaos... and for some reason this made them even more popular. I had just turned the final corner of the Arts hallway when suddenly I noticed an abrupt and eerie silence. Instinctively, I turned my head... my heart sank. There, no less than 12 feet behind me, was the leader of the pack, Kenny, doing his best impression of my awkward gait, his groupies cupping their mouths laughing breathlessly. I went home in tears that day and told my parents that Dr. Gruber was an asshole and a liar. I needed my leg braces back. 2009 Devin...how are we supposed to get anywhere if you don't let Mommy buckle you in? By now we were both laughing so hard, that no sound was coming from either one of us. Another 30 seconds of this and we'd both be peeing ourselves, which would have been much more acceptable for a 2 year boy in diapers than his 29 year old mother in yoga pants. We went through this sequence pretty much every time we had to go anywhere. I could rarely get a full grip on his carseat buckle which left me no choice but to assist with my mouth. This easily should have been a 10-second operation except for the fact that Devin was the most ticklish baby I had ever known. The minute my face pressed up against his belly he was squealing and pulling my hair for mercy, which would only send me bursting into laughter and him howling even louder. Motherhood had found me early in life. I had fallen head over heels with the first guy who had asked me out in HS and we married the summer after my graduation from the Fashion Institute of Technology. Originally, I had set my eyes on becoming a fashion designer but that dream deviated into a bachelors in Interior Design. Sometime during my senior year of high school I had realized that just because my hands were able to draw beautiful runway designs, it didn't mean they'd be able to actually sew them. Still, I had found much enjoyment and challenge in my new major. The campus was small and for the most part, accessible. I was thrilled to learn that my CMT qualified me for campus housing despite the fact I was only a 45-minute train ride from home. I'd finally be able to experience living on my own without having anyone trying to do everything for me. 2016 \"You're Helpless!! I'm out killing myself working 2 jobs and you're home designing stickers and giving your time away like we're fucking millionaires.\" \"Actually, I'm raising our kids, running half the business and the bulk of the household chores, or did you forget those small details? And, I'm volunteering for an organization that's trying to cure my disease...not that you care to notice anyway!\" \"Here we go again, how about getting a real job like every other woman I know?!!\" \"I've broken it down a million times, by the time we pay for daycare, there's not going to be anything left!\" We went back and forth like this for years until it was clear that the marriage was going to be the end of both of us. At 36 it had become blatantly clear that the relationship had done more damage to my mind and body than my actual disease. Piece by jagged piece, we resentfully sorted through 20 years, jumbling together coloring books, bills and family photos from happier days. The forms for my upcoming SS Disability appointment sat on top of the mounting pile. My date had been set for April 17th. I felt both terrified and relieved at the same time. 2019 \"I got you, babe. Stay right there, I'll step on first and help you in, ok?\" My boyfriend, Jason carefully postured himself, legs wide as he raised his long arms to form 2 human railings. I grabbed faithfully onto each, dropping down onto the black lacquered cabin as I let out an audible breath of relief. \"Good job, birthday girl'' he said as I laughed and straightened out my short green summer dress. I could have fallen headfirst into that water and still, I would have come up smiling ear to ear. My eyes widened as they desperately attempted to take in the overwhelming beauty around us, sporadically bouncing from each intricate carving of the bow and across the sparkling horizon of ancient balustrades, gothic arches and marble balconies. A string of deep red celebratory pompoms danced along each side of the gondola, as we pushed off from the Venetian pier and into the warm June air. \"Put your feet up here\" Jason motioned, \"let's get some quick shots of your braces in this light.\" I raised both legs up onto the wood platform and turned them into the setting sun for optimal framing. They had been sponsored by a German orthotics company, and part of my job, aside from attending our annual neurology conference with my colleagues, was to test and photograph them across our 10-day tour of Italy (I know, tough gig, right?) A few months back, when it was time to select a color from the massive chain of vinyl chips, I had stopped instinctively on this particular one. At first, it appeared as a dull and boring grey until, that is, you held it in direct sunlight, in which case it became an iridescent display of every color at once, brilliantly transforming my legs into some kind of magical rainbow show. I turned to Jay and said teasingly, 'Aren't they beautiful? He snapped one more photo and then looked up at me and said, \"yes, you are.\" 2020 \"Low battery\" the notification startled me, instantly snapping me back into my now dim bedroom. How long had I been online? The growing sting in my eyes swiftly answered, \"too long.\" I closed them, rolling my heavy head from side to side until my stiff neck cracked with relief. Dozens of red dots still imprinted in my mind, each representing nearby cities and growing clusters of confirmed cases. \"That's enough for now,\" I said, pushing up from the desk and reaching for the cord to my battery pack. I walked over to the far side of the bed where my headphones still sat from the previous night. The word \"Bose\" now tinted with dark hues of auburn from the window above. Outside, the yard had been covered in a fresh white blanket of snow, all except for the inground pool whose rigid lines had now been perfectly curved and softened into a small crystal pond. Not exactly the scene I had pictured for the \"end of the world.\" I smoothed out the thin purple yoga mat underneath my feet, regaining my balance as I scrolled through my playlist for my go-to track and pressed loop. Spacing each foot along the edges of the mat, I placed my hands down flat, leaning into my palms as they brushed against the tips of my sneakers. All those torturous years of being stretched in PT had paid off. At 39, I was now half human, half pretzel. I'd often credit my abnormal flexibility with keeping my bones intact from my hundreds of falls. One year, I counted 62. Many times I'd laugh them off, saying things like \"I don't break, I bend\" to comfort Jay and the kids. This new storm felt heavier though. This storm was a global one, a Pandemic. I unclenched my jaw and inhaled until each crevice of my lungs were full. The sea of questions and uncertainty began to fade into the tiny bumps of the mat in front of me. My attention now focusing on my tingling fingers and the lavender letters printed above them, \"Gaiam\". After years of staring at this odd word, I had only just recently learned it's greek translation - \"I am mother earth.\" I exhaled as a tear dropped in between my fingers. My heart felt heavy for what was to come but also grateful for this familiar and sacred space I had found so many years ago. \"The melody and lyrics began again... Hold Hold on Hold onto me 'Cause I'm alittle unsteady A little unsteady...

    "data": "An Interview with Kelsey Crowe, Ph.D., co-author of There Is No Good Card for This By Val Walker Dr. Kelsey Crowe is an author, speaker, and founder of Help Each Other Out, which offers Empathy Bootcamp workshops to give people tools for building relationships when it really counts. She earned her Ph.D. in social work at the University of California, Berkeley, and is a faculty member in the School of Social Work at California State University. Regular clients for her talks and workshops include UCSF and Stanford University, among several others. She is a cancer survivor and human survivor, each day finding meaning in connection and a purpose driven life. You can reach her atwww.helpeachotherout.org by Val Walker I first discovered Kelsey's website, Help Each Other Out, two years ago while doing research on how to comfort people living with serious illness. I loved her honesty, compassion and gentle humor in her writings about how to reach out to people in distress. She was learning to live with breast cancer, creatively weaving her personal experience with her expertise in social work and social justice. Drawing from her research, insights and stories, she developed an innovative training program to teach relational skills called Empathy Bootcamp. We chatted on the phone a few times about our common interest in the power of empathy and our writing projects. I found her to be warm, encouraging and generous, even though she had recently endured losing her home in a terrible fire. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Later in 2015, I was delighted to hear she was well on her way to landing a book deal, co-authoring a book with the viral Greeting Card designer of Empathy Cards, Emily McDowell. Kelsey and Emily's book has just come out this January, called There is No Good Card for This: What to Say and Do When Life Is Scary, Awful and Unfair for People You Love. It's a wonderful resource with lively, vibrant graphics and illustrations, yet full of practical guidance for the delicate art of reaching out. Congratulations on your book! What experiences convinced you to write There is No Good Card for This? Kelsey: My experience with cancer was an invitation to write my book. I began writing when my friend in Grad school got cancer, and I wanted to reach out, yet I was hesitant. I felt stuck. What should I say? How did I belong as a friend now? My experience of feeling so powerless as a friend led me to exploring the cause for my hesitancy to reach out to people who were seriously ill. By doing research and interviews, I gathered material about how to offer help for people in times of need. While developing this book, I worked as a faculty member at California State University, teaching courses on public policy. I found research that convinced me how important it was to publish a guide for reaching out to people in crisis. I created a guide book, and I tried submitting this to publishers, but it didn't take off at first. And then, I got diagnosed with breast cancer. That changed everything about how I wrote about helping each other, and I revised my book. I realized I needed to make my private life public. I began a website called Help Each Other Out where I could share my own experiences living with cancer as well as share about so many hard times like loss or divorce and others that affect many of us at one point or another. In addition to the Help Each Other Out website, I collaborated with several empathy experts to develop a training program for lay people and healthcare settings called Empathy Bootcamp, which gives people communication tools for being with others in their time of suffering. With a stronger platform developed for my book, I again worked to find a publisher. Ideally, to enhance my book project, what I envisioned was having it illustrated. I had heard of Emily McDowell, and loved her Empathy Cards, which were going viral in 2014. As a woman who had been through cancer herself, Emily designed greeting cards for people coping with illness. I had wanted a comedic tone to illustrations for my book, and she seemed like the perfect person to approach, but I wasn't quite sure how to connect with her. Then, one day, amazingly, I received a text from a friend at the New York Trade Show who was sitting right next to Emily! That friend connected with Emily in person, and introduced my book project. Soon I followed up and called her. I found out that she had also wanted to write a book about empathy. We talked, and she was pleased that I had already written and researched so much of the material--that the project was fully vetted and ready for her input. So, we created the book together with her illustrations, humor, and ideas. Kelsey, what a remarkable story. It sounds like it was \"meant to be\" that you connected with Emily--fantastic timing, Kismet. You were the perfect duo to create this book! If you could sum it up, what are the five main takeaways of your book, There is No Good Card for this? Kelsey: Here are five takeaways about reaching out to others: Err on the side of doing something rather than doing nothing. If you are trying to decide whether to reach out or not, it's better to offer whatever you can, rather than hold back. You can manage how much you give. Comforting someone can be manageable for who you are, and where you are in life. It's much more helpful to listen than to find that elusive \"useful\" thing to say. Even if you've been ill with cancer, it's important to respect and remember that each person's experience is unique. Use your experience with illness as a good reason to listen to each other. Small gestures make a big difference. Give what you know how to give; and don't wait to be asked to give. A few years ago, you started an innovative training program, Empathy Bootcamp. Many of your participants are healthcare providers and caregivers. How do you teach empathy--or how do you teach a way to \"operationalize empathy,\" as you put it? Kelsey: First of all, empathy is about a way to live and not just about doing your job well. Empathy is a part of connecting and listening in all areas of our lives. In the past few years, empathy has become a popular buzz word. People are interested in learning empathy skills, especially in our digital age. In my Empathy Bootcamps, I focus much of the training on listening skills which are essential to putting empathy into action. I present three different categories of listening that each require different skills. It helps to distinguish empathic listening from the other kinds, as empathy is so important as a first step to establishing a relationship. Empathic Listening: This is listening that builds trust. We start with empathic listening before we go to other interactions. Evaluative Listening: This is where we ask questions to offer up a judgment or assessment. Fact-finding Listening: This is when people ask a lot of questions because they need specific knowledge to be helpful, like when networking with someone to appropriate resources, or when being a patient advocate. Empathic listening is the kind of listening we should do most of the time. The other forms of listening can come across as judgmental, or take the person off track from what they truly want to talk about--so use evaluative and fact-finding listening with careful discretion. Yes, so we need to start with empathic listening to establish a relationship with the person before we move into problem-solving mode. I see how empathic listening lays the foundation of trust and understanding before we get to evaluative listening and fact-finding. Otherwise, we feel more like a commodity than a human being! Kelsey: Right! I'm so glad you are teaching this vital skill in your Empathy Bootcamp. On a more personal note, I was wondering if you could share an experience of being comforted when you were first diagnosed with cancer? What were the gestures of comfort that touched you the most? Kelsey: It wasn't so much the gesture itself, but the timing of that gesture. One evening I was so tired, felt so alone and shut down. I was pushing myself hard to make it to the end of that day. And suddenly that evening I received a delivery of flowers. It was so spontaneous and beautiful. Perfect timing. Another time I told someone I was afraid I was going to die. She just hugged me and held me for a moment, and it helped me so much. What you said convinces me that the little ways we reach out can be vital. One simple gesture just might just come in the nick of time to get us through hell. Kelsey: Right. Our words or actions don't have to be perfect--just reach out. On my worst days, it was such a relief to know someone cared. So true, Kelsey. It's been a pleasure talking with you today--I could talk with you all day! Thanks so much. Kelsey: Thank you!

    "data": "By Karen Pellicano I am not the kind of person who regularly goes to a doctor. I've been told by doctors that they know the problem is worse than I'm reporting, because the fact that I'm willing to go to the office at all, that tells them that something went terribly wrong. When I started going to the doctor with crippling lower back pain, not once, but 6 times in two months, it should have sent up red flags. But at the time, my doctor's office was a training center for new graduates who hadn't picked a specialty yet. Doctors stayed for 6 months to a year, and then continued their education. One said I had IBS, because of my age and the fact that I'm white. One suspected a slipped disc. One decided that I was merely 'hysterical' and should take tranquilizers. And that is how, on a beautiful spring Saturday morning, I ended up howling like a wild animal and waiting for my husband to return from work to take me to the hospital. I'm still not sure why I didn't call 911 - at the time, it honestly hadn't occurred to me. When my beloved pulled in at 1:00, I was waiting with my purse in my hand. The road between his work and our house was out of cell range, so he didn't have any idea that something was wrong. Our daughter was in the house cleaning on overdrive to combat the stress, and I was attempting to comfort her, telling her that I was fine, then laying on the floor in a fetal position and screaming. She didn't believe me. Because I had a couple of hours of agony and no self-control, I turned to online self-diagnosis and determined that it was appendicitis. Armed with this knowledge and a bag to hold the vomit that was erupting from my body, we started the 40-minute drive to the hospital. By the time we arrived, I could barely stand up. I went to the front desk and announced that I had appendicitis. Then I collapsed. My husband came from parking the car and I was already in the treatment room. The nurse told me it was a kidney stone and I told her that I knew she was wrong, because I googled the symptoms and it was clearly appendicitis. Then they gave me morphine and the world started to make sense again. I was only able to have enough morphine to last for 15 minutes at a time, so during those 15 minute intervals my husband and I made plans for next steps. By the end of the 15 minutes, I was barely lucid, begging for relief. And then the wonderful warm sensation of morphine would clear my mind for another 15 minutes of productive thought. A CT scan showed that the left kidney was completely impacted with kidney stones and the right kidney had two stones that were 50mm and 75mm - a 'normal' stone is 2-5mm, and a very large stone is anything over 7mm. I was rushed into emergency surgery for the first of what would be six surgeries to remove stones and try to salvage the left kidney. For the next three months, I was in surgery every other Monday, meeting with the surgeon on Wednesdays to discuss the viability of saving the left kidney and planning the next surgery or watchingGilmore Girls. I still worked every day, even though I had stents in both kidneys for the duration of the three months and by the end of the day Loreli's problems seemed more manageable than mine. Three months later, the left kidney is somewhat intact, functioning at 10%, the right kidney is mostly intact, functioning at 85%, and it's over. Except that it's not. My condition, it was explained to me, is very unusual and I will likely suffer from kidney stones for the rest of my life. The doctors would 'keep an eye on it' in regular tests. I would take a medicine which caused violent stomach revolts. At this point I had been a T2 Diabetic for a few years, and though the kidney complications had nothing to do with the diabetes, the diabetes very much impacted the kidney stones. So I was armed with the food restrictions of diabetes, and the food restrictions of my particular kidney disorder, nauseating medicine, regular testing and a survey to gauge my satisfaction with my care. The food restrictions for each illness contradicted each other and I still struggle to figure out what to eat. I've had many more kidney stones and the diabetes has progressed. The kidney disorder turned into a life-threatening infection when the ICU was full of COVID patients. I learned that I make uric acid and calcium kidney stones, which came with further food restrictions. Four times a year I go for a battery of uncomfortable tests and I have permanent damage to all parts of my renal system. I have the ability to see the future now. My surgeon told me that we know what's going to kill me, we just aren't sure when. I've had 11 kidney surgeries, countless 'procedures', regular stents in both kidneys for weeks at a time, blood tests and quarterly 24-hour urine collections. Now that I have a sense of how my body works, all the fear of the past 7 years is threatening my mental health. Watching my body transform from strong and capable, to withered and tired has brought on a number of interesting changes. When I'm tired now, I sit down. I didn't before. When I'm sad, I cry. When I'm hungry... Well, honestly, I still have a lot of issues around food. And when I used to tell friends 'it's not worth your health' as a solution to their life problems - now I really embrace that reality. For me, it all fell apart on a spring Saturday morning and I'm still reeling from the issues and maintenance that come with that. At my most recent series of appointments, every test came back in a safe range. For the first time in 10 years, I am tentatively healthy. Some days I focus on the word healthy, others I focus on tentatively. Some days I thank my body for what it's come through, others I cry for what is still ahead. I cry for the fact that I will never be healthy without the caveat that it can all be taken away in a minute. And some days, I'm grateful. I've come to realize that everyone should spend a few days or weeks in a body that doesn't work as expected. You learn a lot about yourself and the kind of person you want to be. I was very active before I got sick. I loved hiking and extreme mountain biking. There was no challenge I would rise to and I was proud of that. I hike slower now. I bike on the roads or smooth trails. I'm conscious of the fact that my immune system is compromised. I take medicine and wear a mask in a crowded place. But I also read more. Write more. Think more. Rest more. I'm a more thoughtful and compassionate person. I know that tomorrow could start the road to dialysis or diabetic complications and I take it more seriously. At 54, I'm going back to school to get my Public Health Degree because I want to help people learn to navigate the system that educated me the hard way. I recognize the toll that stress takes and I meditate throughout my day. It's gone from being a 20-minute chore to check off a list, to a regular, normal part of my life. In a stressful meeting, I will excuse myself to go to the bathroom and take a minute to check in with how I feel. I have a continuous glucose monitor that embarrassed me at first, but now it's part of my routine. I don't care who knows and I'm happy to explain it to people with questions. I know that even if I don't know how I feel, the beeper in my pocket knows. Being sick and accepting that I'll never be perfectly healthy again has given me the freedom to drop the shame of imperfection and really start to embrace the flawed people around me. I said my goodbyes and made my peace and then bounced back. Then I did it all again, and bounced back again. Doing end-of-life activities once is humbling, but doing it three times is enlightening. You start to understand what you're saying goodbye to, what you need to hold on to until the very end, and what you have to let go. Karen lives in New Hampshire with her husband and son.

    "data": "By Helen Zazulak After an ultrasound and biopsy, on Friday March 2, 2018, I heard the words no woman wants to hear: \"You have invasive breast cancer.\" My mind went blank. This was the same disease that had taken the lives of both of my grandmothers and inflicted my aunt and mother who are still alive. The radiologist continued as I tried to focus: \"Your tumor is estrogen, progesterone, and HER-2 positive.\" A trifecta of cancer horror, but very treatable. \"We will set up an appointment with a surgeon and an oncologist\".Then winter in New England arrived with a vengeance and the most snow ever recorded in March. A blizzard conveniently came on the day of my appointment with the surgeon and oncologist. Was someone trying to torture me?On the day I finally met with the surgeon and oncologist, I had two cancer survivors with me: my brother, who had Hodgkin's lymphoma in his 20s, and my boyfriend, who had melanoma two years before. Besides my brother and my boyfriend, my cancer team also included my parents. All four are cancer survivors, amazingly!They listened, asked great questions, and provided input - all things they had learned from their own cancer journeys. I'm not the average patient. At my previous job, I tested and researched targeted cancer treatments. One of these treatments, a monoclonal antibody called Herceptin, became part of my treatment plan. During my first meeting with the oncologist, she printed a medical article about my treatment plan, stating: \"I usually give biotech people like you an article to read.\" After reading the article, I felt like I had some type of control over my treatment and the right doctor to be part of my growing team. While waiting for surgery, I caught norovirus, and was sick for two weeks, losing eight pounds. As the surgery date approached, I feared I had lost too much weight and that out-of-range blood test results would further delay my surgery. On a particularly bad Sunday, when norovirus still had its grip on me, I did not make it to the bathroom in time, ruining my clothes. I cried out to God with tears running down my face, feeling especially sorry for myself: \"God, if I have to go through breast cancer, please let me be able to help someone else get through it too.\"The norovirus eased and I passed the pre-op with flying colors, so my surgery went ahead as planned. New England weather even cooperated on surgery day. The surgeon removed my sentinel lymph node, tested my other lymph nodes and got rid of that nasty tumor in my left breast. After the successful surgery, I found out that my lymph nodes were cancer free. Phew! As I recovered from surgery, friends and family came to keep me company and assist me with meals and housework. I couldn't lift anything heavier than one pound, which is pretty much everything. If I overdid it, I would know because my surgical area pounded. One spring day, Jackie - a nurse, friend, and neighbor who built her life around caring for others - stopped over for a visit. Jackie's family and mine grew up together. My parents and Jackie always encouraged my interest in science and medicine. Having them as mentors made a huge impact on me choosing science as my career. Despite our differences in faith (Jackie's family is Jewish and mine is Catholic) we had an understanding because we all believed in the same God who united us all. There's nothing better than a long-time friend who is never out of either interesting stories or the photographs to go along with them. Jackie asked about the surgery and my recovery, sounding just like a nurse, and I explained my limitations. She smiled and offered assistance, but my team had already done most of the \"heavy lifting.\" A couple of months later, before my chemo started, Jackie called and I assumed it was to check in on me. Boy, was I shocked when she said: \"They found something on my mammogram and I have an ultrasound scheduled.\" I responded: \"Oh, I bet it's just nothing. The new mammograms are very sensitive.\"But that's not what happened. Jackie had a biopsy and had the same awful waiting time I recalled from my own experience just months before. She then called with unsettling news: \"I have invasive breast cancer, too! The tumor is estrogen positive. I need to have the same surgery that you had. Because I'm older and my tumor is smaller, the oncologist feels that I will be okay with just surgery.\" Before her operation, Jackie and I sat at my kitchen table discussing medical articles and information about the surgery that I had copied from my own pre-surgical information. In a few weeks, she would have the same exact surgery that I had months before. The timing of the diagnosis and surgery was uncanny. I told my friend Rob, who I had met at a creative writing class as the local technical high school, about Jackie and my cry out to God. What he said would forever change how Jackie and I viewed the situation: \"I became a therapist after reading the Talmud. It says 'If you save one person, then you save the whole world,' and that's what you have done by helping Jackie.\" Here was the answer to my call out to God on that terrible norovirus Sunday. Here I was helping that one person months after my surgery. God had heard me and sent along Jackie. Of course, I would never wish cancer on anyone, especially a longtime friend. But here we were going through the same surgery just months apart.Jackie needed to hear this.After her successful surgery, Jackie called and we had a very memorable conversation: \"Jackie, do you know that saying from the Talmud, 'If you save one person, then you save the whole world?'\" I asked. \"Of course I do.\" I explained about my cry out to God. It did not take her long to make the connection. \"So, that means that God heard you. Because there is no way that I could have gotten through breast cancer without you! Thank you for saving me.\" Over the phone she could not see the tears that came to my eyes nor did she realize how much I would need her words to get through the months of chemo, targeted therapy, and radiation that were coming my way next. I continued my breast cancer protocol, experiencing months of weakness, fatigue, hair loss, and exhaustion. In the spring of 2019, I had my last Herceptin treatment and my energy and hair slowly started to return. Today, Jackie and I both remain cancer free. My family, friends, acquaintances, medical staff, and skilled doctors continue to be my dedicated team. They say that it takes a village. But that's crap. It takes an entire city! Then the pandemic began. After my cancer experience, I was well prepared for stay-at-home advisories. I had been living them since 2018. The same hobbies and activities that were great distractions during my cancer adventure soon became mainstay for the rest of the country and the world. I told everyone that surviving breast cancer is getting me through the pandemic. In late winter 2020, COVID vaccines arrived. We were all filled with hope now that we had a way to combat this awful pandemic. The local technical high school, the same one where I first met Rob at the creative writing class, was one of the COVID vaccination sites in the city. Now that Jackie was feeling so much better from her adventure with breast cancer, when she heard that volunteers were needed at the vaccination site, she signed up. She donned a moon suit and manned the check-in area helping with paperwork. Her actions were right from the Talmud: she was trying to save just one person. And who that person was would soon surprise even me. One Saturday, Rob showed up for his scheduled COVID vaccine at the technical high school vaccine site. And guess who helped him with checking in and paperwork? Jackie! They had never met each other. The only way I knew that they met then was because my mother sent me a photo of Jackie wearing her moon suit at the vaccination site. I emailed Rob the photo of Jackie in her moon suit, and he said: \"Of course, I recognize her. She was the friendly, spunky check-in person at the vaccination site at the technical high school last Saturday.\" So two people who had survived so much and had done so much to save the world already were brought together in some of the strangest conditions: a pandemic, a city vaccination clinic, and a moon suit. It was me, the third person who had saved Jackie, who was able to make this unbelievable connection. Who have you saved today? Who has saved you? Keep your eyes open because they may be smiling at you with their eyes behind a mask at the grocery store or doctor's office. Maybe they are a kind neighbor, the mail carrier, or long-time friend. We are all striving for something every day. We are all trying to save just one person, and in so doing we are saving the whole world and ourselves along the way.

    "data": "by Shaler McClure Wright Segment 8 in our seriesSoul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill Introduction You're listening to episode eight ofSoul Chronicles,offering a soulful perspective on how to navigate the unique challenges of living with ongoing health conditions. Special thanks to Health Story Collaborative for hosting this monthly audio column. My name is Shaler McClure Wright and I'm a writer/creative living with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. Story - The Bittersweet Pain of Letting Go When life is changing, it can be hard to stay connected with your feelings. And for me, it's especially difficult when a big change is happening slowly over time. Sometimes it takes a certain moment--an image etched into our imaginations--to trigger awareness and orient us to the deeper truth at the heart of the change. Last week I had such a moment. Every spring we take our boat out of winter storage and prepare her for the season. And when she's finally in tip-top shape on launch day, we set off on a maiden voyage across Long Island Sound to circumnavigate Fisher's Island. Some years are colder or foggier than others, but regardless of the weather it's always been a joyful tradition, celebrating the start of the summer fun. Last week my husband and I layered-on the foul weather gear and headed out. I took my usual seat in the bow. It was chilly so we had the Sound to ourselves, seeing only two boats in the distance while crossing. Normally that would fill me with an expansive sense of freedom and peace. But instead, I found myself feeling trapped, tight-chested and choking back tears as we approached the island. Normally the beauty of this island gives me a sense of safety, but this year, as we rounded the western tip, my heart felt like it was being sucked into the sea, never to surface again. What was this pain about? Like most people who live with chronic illness, I've developed techniques to cope with physical pain. But I wonder--can I use those same techniques to cope with emotional pain? My only child is graduating from high school this year, marking the beginning of his life as an adult, and the end of his life as a child. It's a threshold experience--as described in last month's Soul Chronicle--and a time for joy and celebration. But for me as a parent, with that joy also comes the bittersweet pain of letting go. Susan Cain, author ofBittersweet; How Sorrow and Longing Make Us Whole, describes this beautifully, \"Bittersweetness is a tendency to states of longing, poignancy, and sorrow; an acute awareness of passing time; and a curiously piercing joy at the beauty of the world. It recognizes that light and dark, birth and death--bitter and sweet--are forever paired.\" I believe many of us who have made peace with chronic illness have also embraced the beauty of life's bittersweet pairings, but we may not know it. I didn't know until reading Cain's words. Now I can see that each time I've needed to muster courage to deal with a new prognosis, or face the loss of some aspect of life-as-I-knew-it, there's been an element of bittersweetness leading me forward to acceptance. Today I want to imagine my way through the bittersweet challenge of letting go of my role as protector of my child, in order to embrace a new role as his liberator. And to do that, I\"ll return to my story of annual maiden voyages in our motor boat. Boating is the glue that holds our family together. We love to escape the daily grind and commune with nature at sea. Preparing a boat for her maiden voyage is a labor of love, and in this way it's similar to preparing to launch a child into independence. If you've maintained a sturdy vessel, then she'll be able to make her way through the sea because she's solid and seaworthy; so too, if you've raised a resilient child, he should be able to make his way in the world on his own. My son Jasper was an infant the first time we took him on a maiden voyage. To mark the occasion, we bought a large marine bean bag and placed it between our pedestal seats so he'd be nestled safely between us while we were under way. It takes about an hour to circle Fisher's Island and we thought that would be long enough for his nap. But no! He just loved the purr of that engine! That year, he was so comfortable and in such deep sleep we had to go around the island twice to avoid waking him. And even though the waves were choppy, he was safe and cozy in our care. The image of him sleeping in that bean bag wearing his red knit cap, clutching a pair of orange velour kitties-one in each hand-is one of my favorite memories. At age six Jasper was a bundle of curiosity, and finally old enough to appreciate our self-guided Fisher's Island trivia tour. On that year's maiden voyage, we revealed to him that Fisher's Island was chosen as the location for a feature film. On its wild and windy west side, there's a big white shingled house with a wide wrap-around porch and sea-gazing gazebo, where the movieThe World According to Garp,starring Robin Williams, was filmed. The property includes a small rocky beach, where the wave action can be quite rough. In the movie, Robin Williams calls out to his young son, who is swimming alone for the first time, \"Watch out for the undertow!\"--a helpful warning from a concerned parent. But that's not what his son heard. His son heard 'watch out for the undertoad,' and from then on he was terrified of a dangerous frog lurking beneath the surface of the water waiting to pull him under and suck him out to sea. Jasper laughed with delight (and perhaps a slight air of superiority) at the idea of such a silly, superstitious child. And his confident smile while staring at that rocky beach that day is another favorite memory. When compared with memories from those two maiden voyages, the images from this year's maiden voyage are stark. If I were to hold all three memories side by side--like a triptych--in my imagination, in the first frame I'd see two smitten parents beaming over their helpless, dependent infant; in the next I'd see two proud parents beaming over their clever, confident kid; and finally I'd see two lost parents scanning the coastline for something that's missing--the continuing presence of their only child. Ack! How depressing! How might I reframe this triptych? Let's take a deeper look at that memorable line from the movie--\"Watch out for the undertoad.\" The first time I heard it, I simply thought it was funny, but over the years, layers of questions beneath the words have begun to reveal themselves. Such as...How often is a cautionary phrase from a parent misunderstood by a child?And...How often do we parents, in our desire to keep our children safe, cause more harm than good with our advice? Author John Irving knew this line would have the greatest effect when spoken by a parent to a child. Coming from a parent, it can be taken at least two ways: as an honest expression of concern for safety, and as an ill-fated attempt to control what is beyond his control. Both are very effective for the book's plot. But the backstory to that line will show us it evolved from a very different circumstance. Ironically, the line 'watch out for the undertoad' came from real life, and the words were first spoken by a child rather than an adult. John Irving's eldest son Colin said it to his younger brother Brendan, who was just six years old. And from then on, young Brendan was afraid to swim in the ocean. The layers of meaning within his words were not lost on Colin, and he even understood why his father decided that for the book, the words carried more literary impact when spoken by an adult. Yes, at age twelve Colin understood that if his father switched the character from child to adult it would make the reader question the concept of safety more deeply. In a 2018 interview withEsquiremagazine, Irving said his son Colin was also the first one who zeroed in on the main theme of the book. Colin told his father, \"If Garp could have been granted one wish, it would have been that he could make the world safe. For children and for grownups.\" 'Watch out for the undertoad' represents our misguided attempts to do so. No matter how much we want the world to be safe and stay the same, there's nothing we can say or do to fully avoid risk or change. That's as true for those of us with chronic illness as it is for parents. Despite our best wishes to offer valuable advice and guidance, and no matter how much we try to prepare our kids-or each other-for the world, we shouldn't be surprised if our wisdom and guidance is not enough or lost in translation. And when push comes to shove, we might need to admit that we're not the great, all-knowing teachers we'd like to be. In fact, we might even need to humble ourselves enough to learn a lesson from our children, just as John Irving received insight from his son Colin. In the context of high school graduation 'watch out for the undertoad' is symbolic of my fear of letting my child go out in the world on his own, but I can also hear it as a clarion call for people with chronic illness. We too need to watch out for dangers that may be lurking in the unknown. Medicine is an evolving science and despite the best care and advice from the people we love and admire, it's up to us to make decisions to keep ourselves safe. For me, the emotional journey of letting go of my child has not been as clear-cut as the symbolic gesture that often marks this occasion. The child's gesture of donning a graduation cap and flipping the tassel from one side to the other seems so matter of fact, when compared with the emotional turmoil I feel as a witnessing parent. How can a transition that makes me so very proud, simultaneously fill me with mind-numbing pain? Perhaps the pain I feel as a parent is most closely related to fear of my son's uncharted future. And if John Irving's son Colin is right, then perhaps the process of setting my child free to pursue his own life is more about fear for his safety, rather than fear of my own loneliness. That would mean my pain is rooted in love rather than selfishness, and that makes it bittersweet. When pain is looming like an undertoad beneath the surface of a fast-approaching future, I think we can feel confident that the skills we use to make peace with chronic illness will also help us make peace with the undertoad. The tension between facing loss versus denying loss is familiar to us. Our experience of 'letting go of health as we knew it' is an example of the bittersweet pain of letting go. Right now, my imaginary triptych of maiden voyages ends with an image of loneliness, and I'd like to transform that. What might be a better ending? Let's imagine a new maiden voyage, but with one big difference-This time I'll visualize Jasper leading the way at the wheel of his very own boat, shouting back over his shoulder to my husband and me as he races through the current off Garp's beach, \"Mom, Dad! Watch out for the undertoad!\" Opening ourselves to learn from our children is one of the unexpected gifts of parenting. Opening ourselves to learn from our fears is one of the unexpected gifts of living a soulful life and embracing the bittersweet. Both can lead us to deeper truths. Thank you for investigating the deeper truth at the heart of high school graduation with me today, and helping me build the courage to watch my son flip his tassel from one side to the other on graduation day without worrying myself sick. Because if I've done my job well, he will be just fine without me.

    "data": "By Alexandria Raspanti Women learn from a young age that their bodies are not inherently theirs. I was not an exception. I grew to understand that I live in a system where autonomy is earned. I was born to be sexualized, my breasts grew to grab, my clothes made to take off, body made to be used. I had a concrete understanding at age 13 that sex was a pivotal part of being desired as a woman. I sat in my bedroom watching the showThe Girls Next Doorand pushing my boobs up in the mirror. I daydreamed about looking like one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends. Tiny waist, pouty lips, bouncy hair, and big boobs. I thought that life would be easy for girls that look like that. I met Aaron when I was 14. After one month of dating, grade 9 began. He decided that we were ready to have sex. I agreed that that weekend we would. We lay in bed and I knew that all I needed to do was get through this and wait for it to be over. It would not last forever. However, when the time came, the nerves interfered. I did not have sex that night, but he did. He left my house, went to a party, and had sex with another girl. I could never make that mistake again. I learned that my reservations make me replaceable. I was grateful to Aaron for not forcing me to have sex with him and finding someone else instead. I felt bad for wasting his time. At the age of 15, I was in a turbulent relationship with an addict. I never experimented with drugs, but I was an expert on them. Day by day I cared for him, I stayed up at night checking his pulse, dipping his feet in cold water, wiping blood off of his face. I thought that mothering him would make him less inclined to hurt me. I don't remember many of these events anymore, but my friends remember my recountings of them. By the time he left for good, I was 18 and he was gone, along with my childhood. He broke up with me when he was done with me. Psychopaths follow a specific routine in their romantic relationships: seduce, love bomb, bond, trauma bond, entrap, use up, and discard. Loving someone who could care less if you were breathing is an incredibly embarrassing and degrading experience. I wish I could say this is where everything changed, but it didn't, not for a few years. Older men have always found a liking for me, although it dramatically declined when I turned 18 and the thrill of an underage girl didn't exist for them anymore. I was 19 and working at a hair salon, and I asked my boss if we could talk about my schedule. He said he would pick me up at 7 p.m. to talk about it over dinner. When I searched up the restaurant and saw the four dollar signs, I figured I should wear a skirt. \"I love that you wore a skirt for me,\" he said while I got into his car. He didn't speak to me about my schedule that night. He told me about his ex-wife, his kids, and the nanny he cheated on his wife with. He told me that I was young and had never experienced a real man. When he dropped me off, he said \"You're not even going to invite me in? How rude.\" Worried about my job, I responded, \"Oh, would you like to come in?\" We were in the elevator as I texted my roommate, \"We're coming up, be in the kitchen so I'm not alone with him,\" and she responded, \"Lexi, I just left the house.\" We went into my living room where he climbed on top of me and started kissing me. He was 43 years old. I can't even try to describe the feeling I had in my throat as I felt his tongue in my mouth. After a few minutes, I said that I had to wake up early tomorrow and that he should go. Reluctantly, he left. The next day at work he called me into his office saying he had my new schedule, and I walked into a pitch-black room. He said, \"I just wanted to get some time with you.\" I quit a few days later. Eventually, I stumbled across a YouTube video on relationships with psychopaths. My eyes were glued to the screen, clinging to every word as she flawlessly described my first love. My breaths becoming heavier as she explained the hows and the whys. The questions I had asked repeatedly in my head for years. She talked about how they choose their victims, and patterns in their mannerisms. I truly UNDERSTOOD for the first time that it was not my fault. In that moment, I felt my soul clinging to my body for the first time, its hands grasping at the insides of my skin, holding me with pinching fingers in a silent promise to never let go. It was in that moment that I let go of my responsibility to men and took on a new responsibility. Myself. I found a lot of my power through learning. I came into college majoring in psychology with an interest in behavioral neuroscience as well as a minor in women, gender, and sexuality studies. I hoped to one day focus on the neurological underpinnings of psychopathy. My mission was to uncover irrefutable proof that abusive behaviors are unrelated to the victims themselves. Unfortunately, awareness alone cannot shield you from the harm inflicted upon you; it merely has the power to shape your responses. I no longer fear people. I am not scared because everything that I would be scared of has already happened to me. There is a certain comfort in the aftermath of abuse - a comfort that stems from knowing that there is nothing you can't get through. Abuse doesn't simply vanish; it lingers, leaving its mark. I deal with obsessive guilt, replaying daily scenarios in my mind, and endlessly questioning what I could have done differently to the point where I could barely leave my home out of fear that I would make a mistake. Yes, lessons were learned and at one point I would have said I was grateful for my experiences, but now, I do not. I believe that the growth I've achieved could have been attained on my own, without the help of my abusers. I now stand, not as a product of my abusers' influence, but as a testament to my own strength and resilience.

    "data": "Segment 3 of 6 in ourSoul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill series. By Shaler Wright Introduction I'd like to thank Health Story Collaborative for working with me to bring you \"Soul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill.\" This monthly audio series offers a soulful perspective on how to navigate the unique challenges of living with ongoing health conditions. My name is Shaler McClure Wright and I'm a writer/artist living with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. Story (audio clip of\"Bring it on Home to Me\" warm up vocals from Roger Ridley) That's the voice of Roger Ridley, a street musician whose soulful voice inspired the collaborative musical movement \"Playing for Change.\" Roger's warming up to breathe life into the timeless lyrics of American singer/songwriter Sam Cook: \"If you ever, change your mind, about leavin', leavin' me behind--\" This music fills us with an undeniable experience of longing, reminding us of things we've lost and long for, and suggesting that what we've lost may well be lost without us too. What if the things we've left behind--the things we've had to give up because of our illness--what if they could reach out to us, and tell us how it feels? \"--oh-oh bring it to me, bring your sweet love, bring it on home to me.\" You see, when we give up something--like running or dancing or hiking up a mountain--because we no longer have the stamina or it causes too much pain-we're also giving up the feelings and memories that go with that activity. You could even say, when something expresses our soul, then giving it up relinquishes a piece of our soul. And bits of soul, when split from the whole, will naturally seek to reconnect. But it's up to us to answer their call. This is the time of year when people try to improve their health by giving things up--like alcohol, sugar, caffeine. But in our dedication to become 'less' we ignore the equal and opposite idea that in order to be healthy, we also need to become 'more'. Like Roger Ridley and Sam Cooke, we need to reclaim some of what has been lost to us, even though, through the very act of reclaiming, those very things will be changed. Let me give you an example: I trained as an actor for many years and was proud of my ability to memorize. Bringing words to life in scripts, stories, and poetry was joyful for me. But my illness has cognitive implications, and over time I've lost that ability to a great degree. So I've avoided opportunities where I'd be called upon to use my memory. But how much of that loss is based in practicality and how much is colored by pride? While it's true I'm no longer well suited for a leading role in a full length play, in leaving the theatre behind, I'm also leaving behind the artists who were like family to me. Effectively, I've exiled myself from my tribe. And exile is lonely. And loneliness goes both ways-- but I never even considered the possibility that my tribe might be missing me too. I never considered that even with my impairment, there might still be some creative way I can contribute and collaborate. And that's short-sighted, not soulful... Because in giving up theatre, I'm also leaving behind the imaginary worlds I used to inhabit through the playwright's plot and a character's dialogue. Whether it was the epic journey of a Russian classic, the treachery and forbidden romance of Shakespeare, or the hard hitting rage of a rebel like Mamet, the range of feelings I got to experience safely, in a contained space where emotional intensity was appreciated, is simply without parallel in daily life. And our creativity suffers with sameness. Sometimes I can still hear in my head the words of a character I've played. Reminding me their story continues, even though I've stopped. Summoning my attention. And as I reconsider the impact of these words, I'm realizing that because of my illness, these words and images and feelings I've left behind are even more dear to me now, and my perspective on their value has deepened. Perhaps those of us with chronic illness can shine new light on old actions. Perhaps we can reclaim the mantle of life's earlier loves and achievements by adapting our approach. We may not be the star athlete of a team or the lead actor in a play, but we can offer a deeper appreciation of what that was like, and give voice to the richness of those experiences. One of my favorite theatre characters was a young woman named Wilma, from the Off Broadway play \"Easter\" by Will Scheffer. Wilma has recently lost her first child in childbirth, and is trying to make sense of her loss while also trying to reclaim her life with her husband Matthew. After acting out her pain in other, inappropriate ways, she describes what she's learned from her experience like this: \"I think the stars have told me their secret, Matthew. They said the secret to shining as bright as a star is just to live here. Just to stay here in this impossible place. And just like how diamonds are made in the earth, from living under the earth, under all that pressure--that's how we turn into stars. It's like gravity is forging us. And whenever we hurt it's just because we're changing. We're changing into stars.\" At the time I performed that monologue I had never been pregnant and had no way of knowing that my illness would also cause problems with pregnancy. But now that I've been through so much to have a child of my own, I can more fully appreciate the way Wilma transformed her pain into light, and that light into a beacon of beauty. And because I'm now a member of more than one tribe, I can also share her words with a new audience; with people like you, who also understand what it is to have felt buried by our pain. The words have a deeper meaning in our world. And I believe Wilma and her playwright would be honored to become part of our world too. So now, whenever I have a rough day, I try to remember the things that gave me joy, that I abandoned too completely. And I open myself to the possibility that even though I'm not able to give them what I once could give, I just might be able to give them something new. And that's true for all of us. But unless we open ourselves to the possibility of reclaiming the favorite things we've lost, we'll never know for sure. So keep your ears open and listen for the melody of longing. It may just be your own past calling you back home.

    "data": "Written by: Laura Beretsky July 15th marks the six-month anniversary of Laura's Law, which sets standards for signage, lighting, security monitoring and intercoms outside locked hospital doors.[1]That it took somebody dying outside the E.R. to require these obvious essentials is a sad statement about our medical system. The law was championed by journalist Peter DeMarco, whose 34-year-old wife Laura Levis died of an asthma attack outside a local Emergency Room. She had taken herself there at 4:00AM in September 2016 but called 911 when she couldn't find the unapparent entrance. Sadly, the ten minutes between Ms. Levis' call, and when she was found in cardiac arrest cost her life. Mr. DeMarco published a Boston Globe article detailing her story in 2018[2]. Reading the details of her preventable death, I was horrified and spellbound, struck by thesystemic patientpowerlessnessbuilt into the medical emergency system. I've had my own challenging experience accessing hospital's emergency services, and while it wasn't fatal, it was similarly subpar. On June 28, 2014, I was taken to the emergency room where the neurosurgeon on call performed a life-saving craniotomy to remove a subdural hematoma. I woke up the next day woozy and disappointed. I have a history of seizures, and the hematoma had developed following an elective brain surgery I'd had two months prior. I was surprised when the hospital discharged me the following day - I'd just had my head cut open, after all. I felt vulnerable because I was: I was readmitted to the same hospital two more times that week following grand mal seizures. The second time was an hour after they'd released me. It was the Esplanade annual fireworks night, so my husband, Mark and I decided to avoid traffic and take the subway home. Two stops after boarding, I felt tingling neuropathy in my left hand -the same precursor for the seizures I'd recently had. I wished I were back at the hospital! \"I'm afraid I might have another seizure. We need to get off at the next stop,\" I told Mark. Approaching Harvard Station, I anticipated the train's brake, and tried not to freak out as the tingles in my hand traveled up my arm.The last two grand mals didn't kick in right away. I will probably make it to the hospital,I thought. \"Maybe we should call 911,\" I said exiting the train. \"No, traffic is miserable because of the fireworks. It's only three stops - let's take the train,\" Mark said. Based on the past week's experience, if I were about to have a seizure, we'd make it on time. Financial calculations bolstered my timing estimates: Health insurance wouldn't cover an ambulance bill. We took the train, arriving at the T stop in ten minutes. During that time, the tingles had traveled up my arm and onto my face. I was coherent, but terrified - my body was succumbing to a seizure's bedlam. Mark escorted me through the hospital lobby to the reception desk. \"My wife's having a seizure. She needs help,\" he urged. The administrator looked at us like we were from Mars. \"What's your name?\" she asked me. \"Laura Beretsky.\" I was lucid, but the prickly sensations had spread to the other side of my face. \"I was discharged less than an hour ago.\" I added. \"Address?\" \"She was just discharged!\" Mark snapped. \"Can't you find contact info in your computer?\" The woman impassively typed. \"So, you're still at 64 Hooker Ave?\"Were they friggin' serious? Did they really think my address had changed in the last hour?? \"That's right. All the information is the same.\" Mark retorted, annoyance overtaking his typically calm demeanor. \"She's going to need a doctor any second. Can you please get somebody?\" The woman completed her electronic intake. I saw her call to another staff person before losing awareness. I know eventually staff took me to a hospital room, as I woke up there the next morning. After that seizure, they kept me five days, during which time I had my fourth grand mal seizure that week - I was grateful I was inpatient this time. Just as Ms. Levis knew she had to be hospitalized in September 2016, I knew my brain was too fragile when I was discharged post-craniotomy. I wasn't surprised that I needed to be immediately readmitted that day, but I was shocked by how hard it was to get back into the hospital. When I read the circumstances of Ms. Levis' death years later, I was appalled but not surprised. Had Mark and I opted for the ambulance, there would have been no questions asked by hospital administrators. Medics would have brought me in and relayed medical details to staff. Instead, we made the decision to take ourselves to the hospital. Like Ms. Levis, our choice to independently seek out emergency care led to glitches when we got there. Ms. Levis's home was near the local hospital. I suspect one reason she chose to walk there was that it seemed like the simplest way to get from point A to point B. I felt the same way when I compared taking the subway to waiting for an ambulance navigating holiday-driven congested streets. It's very possible that the cost of calling an ambulance also played a role in Ms. Levis' decision. That patients must calculate dollar amounts into the equation of making safe healthy choices, as hospitals focus on the bottom fiscal line is another derogatory statement about our healthcare system. Patients are damned if they call 911 -with a bill- and damned if they don't - with hospitals that may be ill-equipped to assist them. Thanks to Laura's Law, the signage and lighting at the local ER Ms. Levis tried to access are clear, the clinic obvious to passersby, and patients can communicate with staff via intercom[3]. While Laura's Law doesn't address penny-pinching discharge protocols and unaffordable ambulance fees, it improves patients' ability to independently access care, an important step toward patient empowerment. Clearly there is more work to do. [1]Governor Baker Signs 'Laura's Law' | Mass.gov [2]Laura Levis was left to die outside an ER.

    "data": "The fact that Dominicans of Haitian descent are treated as foreigners in their own country was hinted at before we even arrived on the island. Contemporary Haitian immigrants to the Dominican Republic and prior generations experience racism and economic exploitation on a daily basis. Our Global Health service trip team was mostly white, so this discrimination would not affect me or many of the other students. However, a black girl from New Jersey was warned that if our guagua (bus) was stopped while in transit, she would likely be asked to step out by military personnel in an effort to control immigration from Haiti to the Dominican Republic. Luckily, we avoided this situation, but during my week on the island I observed many occasions of blatant racism that interfered with healthcare access for Haitians. Each day our team traveled into \"bateys\" - communities - outside of Monte Cristi to support the local health center and their mission of guaranteeing patients the right to health. In the early 1900s, banana companies established bateys for the Haitians and Dominicans who worked the fields during the day, to provide them with a place to stay overnight. Many banana companies have stopped supporting the bateys, making life extremely difficult for those who live there - fruit pickers have been left without the means to support their families, and the economy suffers. While I witnessed impoverished living conditions in all of the bateys, the Haitian batey was the most disadvantaged by far. We arrived at 7:00am to the abandoned banana packing plant and quickly transformed the area into a clinic. 30-40 patients were already lined up. Many of them had walked miles. Some of them had no shoes. Others were carrying one child on their back and another in their arms. I quickly gobbled down my granola bar while huddled over; in hindsight, I should have eaten it on the bus beforehand, away from the patients, considering many of them don't have such easily accessible food. As a pre-dental student, I had been assigned to spend the morning helping the dentist and her assistant. What struck me most were the Haitian children's reactions to seeing the dentist, or lack thereof. In the U.S., it is not unexpected for a child to tantrum when propped up in the dentist's chair. They clench their teeth closed and turn away from the approaching dentist's hands. They cry for Mom or Dad whenever it's deemed safe to open their mouth and howl. In contrast, not once at the pop-up clinic did I see a Haitian child fight the dentist. Not once did I hear them scream at the top of their lungs. Instead, often there without a parent, the child would lie on the chair with his or her mouth wide open, totally vulnerable, and not make a move or a sound. The dentist would scan and scrub and scrape, and then the child would sit up, lean over the side, and spit a mouth full of blood and plaque into a cardboard box filled with dirt. There were no stickers to reward their bravery or high fives from Mom or Dad. The kids were sent off with the only toothbrushes we had (boring adult ones instead of the fun, cartoon-themed ones often handed out in the U.S.), and started the long journey home. I also experienced the impact a language barrier can have. Communication is perhaps the most important element in building a positive doctor-patient relationship. My day in the Haitian batey where everyone spoke Creole reminded me of this. Not being able to greet, instruct, or comfort these patients made me feel helpless. I still remember a middle-aged woman who let out groans so deep I couldn't help but furrow my brow as I imagined her pain. \"?Que le duele? / What hurts?\" I asked. It was challenging enough to understand the woman's response as she gritted her teeth and whimpered in agony, but when she answered in Creole instead of Spanish, I was filled with frustration. The language barrier made it difficult for me to clearly listen to or readily comfort her. Fortunately, we had a team of translators helping us. They translated from Creole to Spanish, and then another group translated from Spanish to English. Nonetheless, there was no way for us students or the non-Creole-speaking American doctors to directly communicate with her. I found this to be extremely limiting in assessing complaints and prescribing medicine. As a pre-dental student majoring in Spanish, I hope to one day be able to combine my passions in order to communicate and empathize with both English and Spanish-speaking patients. My week in the D.R. affirmed the value of incorporating a Spanish language education into my dental career. Had the groaning woman spoken Spanish, I could have reassured her: \"You were right to come here. Everything is going to be ok. We are going to help you.\" My week in the Dominican Republic ignited in me a desire to fight for equal access to healthcare worldwide. I will never forget the struggle of those who live in the bateys. Indeed, they will inspire me as I continue on my journey, and I hope to return one day as a practicing dentist. Until then, I plan to serve in my local community, as great disparities also exist in our own backyard.

    "data": "By Kristine Schiebel At 23, I felt rebellious. Living in Albany, working in a corporate job, it was dark and gloomy. My college friends had told me about Provincetown, so, in May 1997, I decided to quit my job and look for summer employment in this beautiful beach resort. The summer job I found working at a B & B turned into a year-round property manager position at a small cottage colony. I became a Massachusetts resident. I built a life for myself there. I fell in love, made friends, and found community in this small, friendly town. I loved Cape Cod and the ocean. It seemed life could not get any better. In October of 2002, when I was 29 years old, I was out with friends celebrating the end of the very hectic tourism season. We were dancing at the Atlantic House, the oldest bar in Provincetown when I suddenly had a dizzy spell and fell. I attributed it to maybe having had a couple of cocktails. It was unusual, but at that age, I was still partying, maybe too much. The following weekend, my sister invited me to Killington, VT for the weekend to celebrate her birthday. My parents were going to be there. My family had always been close-knit. Driving up, I noticed that I was feeling some vertigo, not to mention that my right hand and right arm were tingling. With the excitement of seeing family, I hoped it would pass, attributing it to the elevation of Killington. But by the end of the weekend, I knew this wasn't true. I had to hold on to a railing just to walk down a few stairs. I didn't tell my family what I was experiencing, because I did not want to burden them. My mother, especially, had always been doting and tended to over-worry. On arriving home, I immediately made an appointment with my GP. He ordered an MRI at Cape Cod Hospital. He said that it was definitely related to my central nervous system and brain, which made me very fearful that I had a brain tumor. My right eye was painful and flickering as well, and my vision was diminished. Then, I developed numbness in my right arm, followed by weakness in my legs and more vertigo. It was fear that crippled most. I was too scared to ask questions. I wanted to stay in denial. I was so young then. I didn't have the strength to respond to what was happening. I felt like a child, helpless, wanting to hide in a corner. After waiting a whole weekend, my doctor finally told me the results of the MRI: probable MS. My first thought--for two seconds--was tiny relief that I did not have a brain tumor, but seconds later, I broke down, because this was life-altering news. Upon receiving the diagnosis, I told my partner, Carrie, that she did not have to go through this. I felt guilty, and that it was unfair to her. We were both so young. She deserved to live her life. I would understand if she left. She said,\"Absolutely not. I am here for you.\"I felt the power of unconditional love--it was immense. So, we put forth our strength. We were ready to fight. At that time, Carrie and I were caretakers of a ten-cottage colony unit. I quickly retired from such a rigorous and physical job. Carrie was by my side throughout the first year of my treatment. She drove me weekly to Beth Israel Hospital in Boston for the first month of my IV treatment. Luckily, we found help on the Cape and received home VNA services. I quickly realized how lucky I was to have a loving partner and family support. Friends came over often. We had potluck dinners. I knew I had a long road ahead, but I felt confident surrounded by friendship and love. By the following spring, my second consecutive flare-up of MS led to bilateral optic neuritis, present in only 5-8% of MS patients. It rendered me legally blind with one eye at 400/20 and the other at 200/20. This prompted my doctor to recommend Cytoxan, a chemotherapy drug used for patients with aggressive MS. This would kill those nasty white blood cells that were aggressively attacking the protective myelin around the nerves in my brain! It worked. I had won the first war. I lost some hair, which was not good, and some weight, which was good. I felt empowered. By July, I had another MRI and the results were good. Many lesions had gone down, if not receded completely, and amazingly I regained some of my vision. Wow! I think I saved some serious brain damage. I remember calling my mother to tell her the good news, and I could hear a faint cry in her voice, which surprised me. I suppose I had taken her love for granted. My mom and I became closer. She would call me a lot, and check up on me. She would say, \"Carrie is your rock. I am happy that you have someone.\" That moved me. She would ask how I was eating and suggest foods. She would tell me about the latest research she and Dad had read about in the New York Times. It emphasized her love for me. Here I was, with my body back and knowing that time was precious. As I have learned, this disease is progressive. I would never take anything for granted, or anyone. I could stand up straight, and walk, and I was running. Running down the beach, taking in all of that sea air. I was going to make it. Inspired by this recovery, I took control and researched what to eat to nourish my body and feel good. I became neurotic about food, eating plenty of fruit and fish, which are plentiful in Provincetown. I ran half an hour every day and went to the gym six days a week. I learned how beneficial it is to maintain strength and endurance, and a nice body. I could no longer drive, so my bicycle became my transportation until I could no longer use my legs. I learned about other healing techniques and practices, including yoga, and I would practice on a daily basis. I overdid it with yoga mats everywhere in the apartment, which drove Carrie crazy. In 2004, we moved to a more convenient and quieter apartment in town. At that time, there were not many options for treatment, so I was on an interferon drug. Once a week, Carrie would stab me with my IV injection of Avonex. The only side effects turned out to be a headache and fatigue. Whatever--just like waking up with a hangover and the next day I would feel fine. Then, I found out that it only has a 33% efficacy. It turned out that it also elevated my liver enzymes. My GP in town said, \"Are you still partying a lot? Your liver enzymes are through the roof!\" That comment made me angry. She knew I was sick, and working so hard to fight this disease. I had never partied enough to elevate my liver enzymes. My neurologist started me on Copaxone instead of the interferon, but this drug also had low efficacy. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands, knowing that I would have this disease my whole life. I found out that acupuncture is helpful. I eliminated dairy and gluten from my diet, exercised, and prayed. Yes, I became spiritual. I guess you could call that the gift of desperation--God. Talk about something that brings you to your knees! Having been raised Catholic, I returned to my faith. I knew it had been there for me before, and would be there for me now. I feel like my beautiful life was synchronistic--coming to Massachusetts, moving to Provincetown, and meeting my first love. If that had not happened, I would not be in Massachusetts with the best healthcare and insurance for people with disabilities. I really don't think that I would be here without spirituality. You have to believe in something bigger than yourself. By the end of summer 2004, I made the decision to go back to work, as I was denied disability the first time. Yes, I know 30 is too young to apply for SSDI, but the optic neuritis had left me legally blind. My eyes had healed to 20/60 with transient blurriness. Carrie got me a job at her magazine doing secretarial work. The job increased my confidence but did nothing for our relationship. Still, I was proud that I had completed a whole season at the town's local magazine, using my voice and my personality. It had been clear by the early part of 2005 that Carrie and I were approaching the end of our chapter. After 8 years together, we decided to end our relationship as amicably as possible. I rented a room in a friend's house. In November 2006, I was invited to a potluck by a friend from work. I was introduced to Heather, the daughter of the host. She asked who brought the sushi. I said I did because I didn't have time to do anything, and we laughed. I felt strong, showing no signs of MS. A social, healthy 33-year-old. In the back of my mind, I would ask myself why I was still partying. I should be grateful to be stable. Kristine, WTF! I should stop drinking, and eat better. Who was I fooling? I was strong but taking it for granted--like a college kid partying it up every night. But what saved me was that Heather was very much invested in my MS. I told her on our first date on December 15, 2006. She responded that she had a similar neurological episode happen to her. We bonded over it. She fortunately did not have MS and did not care at all about my disclosure. How lucky was I? Heather was instrumental in getting me to a better place because with love anything is possible. I stopped drinking. She was my biggest cheerleader and supportive of my new health regimen, no partying and staying healthy. We had lots of fun together. From the time that I met Heather, I had been on 3-4 different medications, during which I was deteriorating physically. She was always there to catch me, literally, to hold me up and stay strong, keep fighting. She took me to every appointment, and when she couldn't, her mother, Ellie, did. I inherited a mother-in-law. She came with the package. I became very close to Ellie, and she joined my MS care team. Just knowing that you are not alone is everything. I continued to fight my MS with a new treatment called Rituxan. Fast forward: On my 40th birthday, I went to a neurology appointment, accompanied by Heather and my sister Kara. We were planning to go for a celebratory lunch afterward. Unfortunately, after testing my strength, and seeing me walk, my neurologist declared me to have secondary progressive MS. Reality set in at that point. Happy birthday to me. Luckily, I had the comfort of Kara and Heather and the security that they would be there for me. So, I focused on having something to look forward to. Heather surprised me with a trip to Sedona, Arizona, which was amazing and beautiful. With the lack of humidity there, I was able to walk 20 yards, which was new for me at that time. Something small to celebrate, even though I knew it would not last. Forcing me to stay in the moment and enjoy it. By summertime, I was officially using a walker and a mobility scooter, accepting the state of my disease, knowing I had support and love. I still wanted to be part of life. I wasn't ready to throw in the towel and isolate myself in a prison of disability and disease. I worked during the summer as a hostess at a restaurant. I always loved working with people. I felt empowered and strong. This was my town. I knew I was pushing myself, especially in the summer heat. Heather would drive by the restaurant and throw me an ice pack. So sweet. It helped and I got through it. It made me stronger. Every day, I would say, \"Not today, MS. You're not going to get me today.\" Six months later, I had a second Rituxan infusion.Heather could not accompany me, but her mother did. I felt comforted and loved. Heather called me that night to see how the appointment went. I noticed that she did not sound good--weak, tired, and slurred speech. I did not have a good feeling at all. I thought, there had been so much focus on me. I need to tell Heather to take care of herself. The next morning, I woke up panicked, and a little dizzy. I thought it was because of the infusion. A few minutes later, I got a call from Heather's phone number. My chest sank because it was not Heather. It was a friend of her mother's. The voice said,\"Kristine, are you sitting down?\"Nervous laughter-of course I was sitting down! She proceeded to tell me that Heather had passed away. I was frozen, paralyzed with my mouth open, trying to say, \"What?\"and then hanging up. My friend took me to Heather's mother right away. That's when I finally lost it, crying uncontrollably. Apparently, it was a brain aneurysm that occurred overnight. Ellie was never able to give me the full details. We did stay in touch and had weekly lunches, for a while. In the meantime, while trying to grieve, I had to figure out my life so I could at least get by for the next few months. I sought out help to stabilize my mental health and at least keep me living at home. During this time, a friend of mine had lost her job and housing, so I said that she could live with me, thinking it would be a win/win as she could help me with my daily care. I had no time to make decisions. I was just determined to stay in my home, so I made my friend Mary my caregiver and we signed up for the adult foster program. It was soon clear that I had made the wrong decision. She was controlling, verbally abusive, physically threatened me on one occasion, and kept me from seeing my friends. When my sister Kara came to visit, she opened my eyes to the reality that I had to get out of this unhealthy situation. I thought to myself, I still have my voice and my mind. I am not going to let this woman ruin what is left of my life. With the help of my therapist and Kara, I found the courage to stand up for myself. My breaking point came one day when Mary was being unnecessarily rude and ruthless. I said:\"You need me more than I need you!\"and told her I could not live like that. It jolted me into action. I was surfing online for options other than the geriatric nursing homes, where Mary had occasionally threatened to drop me off. I typed \"MS long-term care\" and found The Boston Home. My social worker confirmed that it was a great place and said she would recommend me. I was scared of leaving my home of twenty years and the few people that I still had in town, but I also felt hopeful. I had been in a very dark place. Losing the love of my life and my disease quickly deteriorating had left me isolated. I no longer had Heather, but I remembered her telling me: \"You don't have to live imprisoned in that little apartment.\"Her love carried forth as I made the decision to make some changes. I gave it over to God, and thought, if there is a space available, then it is meant to be. Upon receiving the news that I was accepted to The Boston Home, I had a mix of excitement and fear. After being so dependent on one person and living in a small town, this would be where the strength and courage that I had bound up in me would need to come out. Miraculously, within 8 months, Lucille welcomed me with such love and compassion. Just another reminder to never throw in the towel when you think you are at the end of your rope. This would be my new home, where I could feel myself on my own wheels or whatever. When I first moved here, you should have seen me. I would zip down the halls to feel the wind in my hair. I made some friends, laughed and commiserated. There is always room for growth in every situation. It was refreshing to be around folks who had been through a similar journey/nightmare rollercoaster of MS. Everything about MS and the possibility of healing and recovery had taken over my life for the past 20 years. Now, I could just relax in my own space and with my own people, even if we did say \"F. it!\" sometimes. Unity would be our strength-- a renewal of strength just like after my remitting from my first MS attack. Being disabled, my biggest fear was losing my power because I felt like my power was in my body. But, I realized that as long as I had my mind and my voice, I could regain the power I thought I had lost. I learned to hold on to my power and use my voice.\"Always remember that your present situation is not your final destination. The best is yet to come.\"Never give up. Stay strong. Have faith.",

    "data": "My name is Nancy Marks. I have been a Boston-based printmaker and painter for more than twenty-five years. In addition to solo exhibitions, my work has been displayed in galleries, restaurants, and corporate settings. I am also a public health advocate and art teacher who is committed to helping others use art to engage in personal healing and community dialogue. In 2014, I created The Intimacy of Memory, a body of mixed media paintings based on grief, love and remembrance. The work examined why people chose particular objects or keepsakes after someone close to them died. I was interested in the ways in which an object represents the person who died and the shared relationship with the survivor. How do objects celebrate a life? How do objects prompt memory and how does this memory change over time? This body of work seeded itself fifteen years ago when the biological mother of my adopted daughter, Taylor, died of AIDS. Taylor was six at the time. As I cleaned out her mother's apartment, I had to decide what to keep. Which items would hold memories of her mother and offer Taylor comfort both in the moment and throughout her life? As I selected a few dishes, her mother's favorite shirt, a locket, a mirror, I knew it wasn't just what I kept but also what I didn't keep that would play a role in Taylor's recollections. As part of this exploration, I interviewed participants and meditated on what I had heard. When I began to paint, the layers of color seemed to mirror the layers of their recollections: feelings of loss, love and longing. While many details faded into the background, what I felt most acutely was the sense of connection that stretched from the present to the past. I began to see how relationships and roles become fixed in time and space at the moment of death. How we forever remain mother/father/grandfather, husband/partner, sister/daughter/granddaughter. As I exhibited this work throughout Massachusetts, I started to feel that I wanted to more closely connect my art life with the power of personal narrative. Since this initial body of work, I have begun to host Intimacy of Memory workshops. The Intimacy of Memory workshops are designed to allow participants to make art based on the objects they kept after a meaningful loss in their life. It approaches the complexities of grief and love using art as a central connector. Because so many don't have language for loss, art can play a pivotal role in communicating emotion and promoting healing. Whether the loss is fresh or long past, this workshop gives artistic space and voice to the grief and love you may have been nursing privately. While the subject is heavy for many, there is often laughter and joy as people share memories. But the work doesn't stop there. After a workshop, participants are encouraged to hang their art in public space. The goal of the public exhibition is to promote a community conversation about death, grief and love, three subjects that are often privatized in the broader culture. I know how deeply painful loss can be, but we make the healing process that much harder by not giving our losses adequate \"time.\" After all, grief is really just remembering how much we love and miss those we have lost.",

    "data": "Segment 7 in our seriesSoul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill By Shaler McClure Wright Audio Story Transcript Introduction You're listening to episode seven ofSoul Chronicles,offering a soulful perspective on how to navigate the unique challenges of living with ongoing health conditions. Special thanks to Health Story Collaborative for hosting this monthly audio column. My name is Shaler McClure Wright and I'm a writer/creative living with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. Story - On Thresholds, Rabbit Holes, Wardrobes and Transitional Space Can you remember the most significant days in your life? I bet you can, because the events on those days were most likely threshold experiences, and as such, they've received a special place in your memory, preserved with almost cinematic detail. Most commonly, the word threshold refers to a place where you make a physical crossing--like walking over the sill of a doorway or through the entrance of a building. But it also refers to various points of 'beginning' that can be cultural, psychological or emotional--as in rites of passage or life's milestones. Similar to a crossroad, a threshold requires a choice to be made, aleaving behindto gain something new. But a threshold also contains an additional component--the transitional space of in-between. Limen is the Latin word for threshold; Limen refers to the border between one thing and another. And within this borderland is something called liminal space--which can be thought of as the transitional space between two locations or phases. An example of this, in the literal sense, could be the walls of a tunnel through which one must pass. An example in the metaphorical or symbolic sense might be the period of engagement between a marriage proposal and the wedding. In both instances the transitional space holds an aura of other-worldliness-a heightened sense of reality where unusual things can happen. Jungian analyst Katherine Olivetti suggests that navigating thresholds and transitional space requires new attitudes. She says, \"The experience can be felt as frustrating, painful, exhilarating, challenging, frightening or liberating ... This is a place where the opposites are not clearly defined, where rules are suspended, collisions abound, and new possibilities emerge.\" Sounds frightening to me, but it also sounds thrilling. When friends and family undergo a threshold experience, I'm especially drawn to their stories of time spent in the transitional space of in-between, because that time can have a mystical, almost magical quality, fostering breakthroughs to new ways of thinking and being. A dramatic example of this could be the story of a near-death experience. Thresholds are places of potent energy. The emotional energy involved with facing a threshold is complex and often contradictory. It can swamp you with a sense of overwhelm, or elevate you to a new perspective with more clarity. So when life accelerates and change is imminent, it's wise to become well-practiced in moderating your response. As Irish poet John O'Donohue has described, \"A threshold is not a simple boundary; it is a frontier that divides two different territories, rhythms and atmospheres.\" Indeed. Each time we find ourselves standing at a threshold, we also receive an implicit invitation to reconsider our priorities and attachments. And that takes courage and practice. Thresholds often accompany the milestones in life, and if I think about it honestly, my emotional response to those occasions has rarely been one-dimensional. Maybe that's true for you, too. In fact it's quitelikelya threshold experience will stir up all kinds of conflicting emotions, even if the threshold is one to celebrate. And those emotions can wreak havoc on our ability to think, feel or see clearly. O'Donohue believes the emotional intensity of a threshold experience is connected to fear of change. \"To change is one of the great dreams of every heart - to change the limitations, the sameness, the banality, or the pain... But change is difficult.\" Along with courage, we also need trust. \"To acknowledge and cross a new threshold demands a sense of trust in whatever is emerging.\" But courage and trust take time to develop. Perhaps transitional space exists because it is needed. When we're in the midst of a threshold experience, weneedthe transitional space to give us time to develop courage and trust. Here's an example of what I mean: I remember how I felt on the day I first received my diagnosis. Time stood still and my mind went gray. I felt a physical sense of standing in between 'life before' and 'life from now on.' I remember feeling shaky and uncertain. It was scary, but now I recognize it's common to feel that way while standing in transitional space. That space is where I mustered my courage. That space between two points of being. Between what was familiar and what is unknown. Because of our medical challenges, thresholds are likely to be familiar to those of us who have faced the reality of chronic illness. And I believe our experience can give us a leg up when it comes to helping others who are facing thresholds of their own. Should the opportunity arise, we are primed through our experience to be valuable threshold guides. I hope to talk more about how we might serve as valuable threshold guides in the next Soul Chronicle. I also believe those of us with ongoing health conditions can develop special strengths. For instance, in order to balance truth with hope, we might find ways to pair child-like curiosity with adult-like courage. Or we might learn to find beauty in loss, or learn to take strength from facing disappointment or the unknown. The ability to engage with change is most effectively fostered in childhood. When I think of well-known threshold experiences, I find myself remembering images from childhood literature. Most of the storybook characters I continue to admire have navigated a significant threshold with child-like curiosity, and through their experience, have grown wiser to tell the tale. Let's take a closer look at two of these characters; Alice, from Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,\" and Lucy from \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" by C.S. Lewis. Alice begins her series of threshold experiences in a mad rush, while Lucy begins with careful consideration of her transitional space. First, here's Alice in the passage when the rabbit first captures her attention: \"It flashed across [Alice's] mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. [And] in another moment, down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\" The rabbit-hole is a threshold. But Alice didn't pay any attention to the transitional space in-between the entrance and the exit. She also never took time to consider the risks of going down the rabbit-hole; instead she was completely driven by impulsive, child-like curiosity. And that's a good place for a child to start, but it deprives her of the wisdom she might've gained during the transition. As the story continues, Alice is faced with more threshold experiences, and with each one she opens herself up a bit more to the mysteries of transitional space. And her growing discernment and worldliness is representative of how we too, might grow in our own experience. Now let's consider a passage in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" where young Lucy decides to push her way through a secret entrance to a magical world hidden in the back of a wardrobe full of old fur coats. \"She went further and found a second row of coats hanging up behind the first one. It was quite dark and she kept her arms stretched out in front. She took two or three steps further in. [...] Then instead of feeling the hard, smooth wood of the floor of the wardrobe, she felt something soft and powdery and extremely cold. [...] The next moment what was rubbing against her face and hands was no longer soft fur but something hard and rough and even prickly. 'Why, it is just like branches of trees!' exclaimed Lucy. And then she saw a light a long way ahead of her. Something cold and soft was falling on her.[...] She was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air. Lucy felt a little frightened, but she felt very inquisitive and excited as well.\" Unlike Alice, Lucy took the time to experience every sensory element during her transition, and because she was grounded in the physical reality of her surroundings, I believe she was able to move past her fear and face the magical, snowy woodland with the same excitement as an explorer in the age of discovery. Lucy's flexibility and open mind serve as examples of the kind of strength to be gained from a threshold experience. And both of these qualities are available to those of us who pass through medical thresholds as well. Although a threshold can feel like a curse at the time of occurence, in retrospect, I believe it is a gift. Especially since part of the challenge of being chronically ill is to feel and face every dimension of the experience, rather than dissociating. If we can stay present, then with every threshold experience of transitional space comes an opportunity to become both wiser and deeper. And every time we become wiser and deeper, we are also becoming more soulful. Goherefor more episodes of our Soul Chronicles series.

    "data": "By Chris Anselmo Watch Chris perform his storyhere Growing up in Connecticut, I was obsessed with basketball. Everyone in the state disagrees on sports allegiances between Boston and New York, but everyone is obsessed with the Uconn men's and women's basketball teams. I watched my first game at age 9 and was hooked. I'd shoot hoops in the backyard pretending I was my favorite Uconn players. I played on town leagues in middle school and high school. Basketball was always on my mind. I knew I wasn't good enough to play in college - I was 5'9 and hated playing defense - but it brought me great joy and comfort to play, even if my skills were limited. I played basketball care-free, because I had full mobility. I could run and jump and dribble and shoot without any limitations. (Leaping was another story). In fact, limitations were not on my radar. Until I was in a car accident my senior year of high school. Then, I realized that I was not invincible. I was not indestructible. It was because of this accident and the subsequent blood draw that I learned something was wrong inside of me. My creatine kinase, or CK, levels, which should have been only a few hundred, were in the tens of thousands. CK is a biomarker that indicates how much muscle breakdown is taking place in your body. So, a level in the tens of thousands indicated that my muscles were breaking down rapidly and at an alarming scale. But why? After ruling out internal injury, liver problems and other diagnoses, I was diagnosed with a muscle disease I was told would manifest in adulthood, called limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B. It was a strange, unsettling moment, learning you had a disease before you had symptoms. It didn't add up with my life experience to date. I had no physical limitations. How were my muscles defective? And given that I was just about to start college, as long as I was asymptomatic, I put it out of my mind. I was 18 at the time. Part of it was denial - I didn't believe the diagnosis was real. In the fall of 2004, 11 months after the car accident, I started college at Northeastern University in Boston. It was a city I grew up visiting with my family, and to live here full-time was a thrill. I loved walking around the city. I would often refuse to take the subway and instead walk to and from different destinations, even if they were miles away. I had never lived in a place with so many restaurants, museums, great architecture and people from all walks of life, that I had to see it and experience it. I would hang out with my friends and go to parties and take in as many experiences as possible. I loved the accessibility of Boston, how everything was within walking distance. I wore down many pairs of sneakers walking the city. There was no indication that I had any physical restrictions. There was no indication that I was a ticking time bomb. But then, after graduation from Northeastern, like a light switch, my symptoms started. I was going for a run one night after work and after a few minutes, my legs began to burn and I could no longer run. The rest of my body was willing to continue but my legs were having none of it. I thought it was odd but I didn't think much of the root cause. I made excuses in my mind. I was stressed. I was an account maintenance coordinator for a large financial firm and was working long hours. It was boring work and my heart wasn't in it. I figured I was just tired and run down from hating my job. Deep down though, I was unsettled. I remembered the words my pediatric neurologist five years back told me - someday I would need to visit an adult muscular dystrophy clinic, and that I would start to experience weakness. Eventually. Could it be that what I expected to take place later in life would happen now? But then, a few months later, I moved to a new apartment, a two-story walk-up in Brighton, and towards the end of move-in, carrying a desk chair up the stairs, my legs froze up and I couldn't carry the chair anymore. I placed the chair down and pulled myself up the final two steps with the railing. Something seemed off. I woke up feeling excessively sore and sluggish. The questions in the back of my mind were now front and center. Doubt chipped away at my inner resolve. I knew that the disease was starting. There were too many coincidences for this to be pure chance. I couldn't use work as an excuse anymore. In November 2009, I took the advice I received five years ago and followed up with a neurologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who confirmed my diagnosis. I was shocked, even though I knew deep down that I had the disease. For five years, since the accident, I was operating under the false assumption that this disease would hit later in life. To realize that it was happening now, and that it would be severe enough to land me in a wheelchair, was too much to bear. I left that day in a state of shock. I sat down on the bench outside the waiting room, and stared blankly out the window. The late afternoon sun shone brightly into the window. I looked into the sun not caring if it blinded me. I was crushed. As the years passed, the symptoms progressed. A year later, in 2011, I was walking up the hilly part of Washington Street in Brighton, intending to pick up some toothpaste at CVS. As the ground flattened out at the top of the hill, my right knee spasmed and gave out. I was embarrassed and scared. To collapse under the weight of my own body was an unsettling feeling. In the subsequent few months, falls happened over and over, at home by myself and in public in front of dozens of people. A year after that, I fell on my way home from work and couldn't pick myself up on my own. I pulled on a nearby fence to get to a standing position, almost causing the wood to break in the process. I realized I needed an assistive device - crutches and leg braces. I needed something because I could not go on like this falling every other day, and expending all my energy to get up or relying on complete strangers to do so. That's when it really hit home. I became depressed and turned down social events, afraid to go somewhere where I might fall in public. I was very sensitive to how I walked, on my heels, and how my gait was slowing down. I noticed that when I got on the bus to go home, I had to hold onto the railing to propel myself up, since taking a step unassisted was getting too difficult. I felt like I was carrying a 30-pound weight everywhere. The depression - a disinterest in things that used to interest me, fatigue, constant headaches - got worse when I started to notice separation between my friends' lives and my own. They were getting married, buying houses, getting a dog, eventually having children. I had none of those things, but was consumed by the state of my body. I was on a downward spiral. If I found life to be too difficult, where would that leave me? What was the end game? I struggled to think about it. I struggled to think about anything. Many times I found myself reclining in my desk chair, staring out my window, usually snowing or raining, contemplating life. This wasn't how I saw my post-collegiate life going. But I knew, difficult as it was, that this downward spiral either would have a terrible ending, or I would find a way to turn it around. In order to do the latter, however, I had to change my mind and refocus. I thought about my goals, and how they were sitting on the backburner, unfulfilled. On a snowy Saturday in 2013, I wrote down my goals, and forced myself to find a way to make them work. I realized, although difficult, many of my goals were achievable. One such goal was to go to business school. I had contemplated business school for many years. Every year I would consider going, but talked myself out of it. I was too weak, I thought. I felt like it was no longer possible. But this time, I forced myself to do it. I took the GMAT exam and scored well enough to get into several Boston-area schools. In 2014, I quit my job and enrolled at Boston College's fulltime MBA program. It was a huge risk - no income coming in, taking on loads of debt, taking a full slate of classes, moving to a new apartment in a new town. But it was a risk I wanted to take. It was time to see what I was made of. I attended Boston College from 2014 to 2016. It was a transformative experience. I met dozens of lifelong friends who I continue to talk to to this day. When I started the program, I worried how I would be perceived. Would I make any friends? Would I be prevented from going to social events either because I wasn't invited or because the venue was inaccessible? Would I be able to handle the rigors of early morning classes, tests, finding an internship, etc.? And if I struggled to make friends, would I quit and drop out? At first, I thought that answer was yes, that my disease would be a barrier. During orientation, we paired off with the person next to us to practice case interviews. Somehow, I found myself alone. I couldn't easily get out of the auditorium's flip chair, so I stayed put, content to practice alone. I felt the isolation of my condition and how different I was. Then, as if someone was reading my mind, someone plopped down in the seat behind me and stuck out their hand. I turned around, it was a man, about my age, in glasses and a suit without a tie. He saw I was alone and wanted to be my partner. Brian, as it turned out his name was, would become one of my best friends in the program. We continue to stay in touch til this day. Over the coming weeks and months, I met more and more of my classmates, and felt comfortable opening up to them about my condition. My classmates, once I disclosed bit by bit that I had a progressive neuromuscular disease, were accepting. They looked out for me. They soon would give me rides, carry my backpack, and in several instances, pick me up off the ground after a spill. They became friends. They became family. School wasn't bad, either. I learned a lot about business (although never quite mastered accounting), and spent a summer in New York City interning at Pfizer. I never thought I would get to live in New York. I rebuilt a lot of the confidence I had lost over the years, once I saw that I could do something as difficult as business school. Those two years taught me a lot about myself, and about life. Although my condition has deteriorated significantly, and I am now a full-time wheelchair user, I feel like more is possible than ever before. I like to do public speaking and have given talks and been on panels at several conferences. I have written a blog for the last three years and have been published in several publications. I am writing a book. The job I have now, working for the Muscular Dystrophy Association in a partnership management role, is one that I love. The world is at my fingertips, although it takes more effort, planning, and logistics than before. But all is still possible. One such example is conferences. In order to attend an industry conference (back when we had in-person conferences), I have to plan out the logistics to a T. I need to find an accessible room that has the right dimensions for my wheelchair and my care. I need to make sure I have help, usually in the form of my parents, to help me. Then there's getting there, which usually involves a long car trip, and staying at hotels along the route if the location is far. It's tiring to plan out all the logistics, and even then, there are bumps in the road. But on the other hand, I wouldn't be going to the conference in the first place if I hadn't taken this path. It's a double-edged sword of sorts. It hasn't been an easy road. I am still nostalgic for simpler days when I could move around easier, and didn't have to worry about falling. I miss shooting and dribbling a basketball. I miss spontaneity and going places on a whim. But it has been a learning experience. I take solace in connecting with others who are just starting out on their disease journeys. I have experienced a lot of missteps on my journey that I hope to share with others, so that they may avoid making the same mistakes. How to handle it mentally, how to seek out help, that sort of thing. I hope to share with others that the best way to fight a life-changing disease is to fight it head on, rather than retreat in denial.

    "data": "What if you were suddenly diagnosed with a potentially fatal disease just when your life, work and marriage were on track and your plans to start a family where underway? This is what happened to Sue R. Levy. In 2008, at age 37, she was diagnosed with Pulmonary Lymphangioleiomyomatosis, otherwise known as LAM. LAM is a rare, chronic, progressive lung disease in which the lungs fill up with cysts. The result is gradual destruction of the normal lung architecture, compromised breathing, and in many cases, eventual lung transplant. Fueled by estrogen, LAM primarily affects women in their childbearing years. With only 1300 documented cases in North America, LAM is poorly understood and at present no therapies of proven benefit exist. Prior to diagnosis, Sue would have defined herself as happy and healthy. She had a successful career as a marketing executive, she was happily married, and she and her husband had decided to start a family. Though they struggled with infertility, undergoing six unsuccessful rounds of IVF, Sue still felt that this would work out eventually, and that perseverance would pay off. In her words, \" My whole life I thought the way the world worked is that if you were a good person and you worked hard you could avoid bad things\". LAM changed everything. Suddenly, Sue was forced to redefine herself as someone with a chronic disease and confront her own mortality. In addition, she had to let go of some of her dreams, first and foremost her desire for pregnancy, as the high levels of estrogen associated with carrying a child would accelerate her lung destruction. Initially, she was angry. What had she done to deserve this? Over time, though, her perspective shifted. She came to accept her diagnosis and she let go of her preconceived notions of how her life \"should\" unfold. Today, Sue would say that living with a chronic disease and an uncertain future, while obviously challenging at times, has improved her life dramatically. Her disease has helped her to get in touch with what she really cares about, and has set her life on a new course. With the goal of educating and healing herself, she went to school to study nutrition and became a natural foods chef. In 2011, inspired by how great she felt after making some lifestyle changes, she quit her marketing job and started Savory Living, a nutrition and healthy eating company that provides online nutrition andhealthy eating classesand cooking classes, helping others to \"eat well and feel better now.\" In addition, Sue and her husband now have two young daughters, conceived using egg donors and a gestational carrier. While the journey was difficult at times, the end result is a beautiful family. Sue feels happier and healthier than she ever has. In an upcoming follow up piece, Sue will share more about her struggle with infertility and her journey to motherhood. Originally published on WBUR Commonhealth Blog on April 4th, 2014.

    "data": "By Annie Brewster, MD Suddenly everything is different. The quiet is a mix of unsettling and lovely. The chaos and constant motion I have grown used to are gone. No more frenzied efforts to get kids up and out of the house for school in the mornings. No more packing the dreaded school lunches. No more feeling like a taxi driver as I shuttle my kids from sporting event to sporting event, shivering in hockey rinks and on lacrosse sidelines, the sports mom I swore I would never become. And yet I miss all of this. The structure was comforting, or at least predictable. We are all working to create new structure. I hate board games, but we are playing them at night, because my thirteen-year-old forces us to. This is what her friend's families are doing, apparently. Move it along, please. It was Mrs. Peacock in the Ballroom with the wrench, I guess prematurely. We are striving for normalcy. Thank god for online school, and for the fact that my kids are old enough to manage their own learning. It helps my anxiety, and theirs, to have \"classes\" scheduled. There is so much that is unknown. Anything predictable is helpful. I feel grateful that I can put on my scrubs and go to the hospital for my scheduled shifts. It gives me purpose. It makes me feel useful. I am grateful for this. I hear my son telling his ninth-grade classmates during a zoom class that his mom is working in the hospital, seeing patients with COVID. His voice is strong and confident when he says this. He feels proud, and it gives him purpose, too. Yes, I am grateful. I have never been a germaphobe and I'll admit, I sort of poo-pooed this whole COVID thing at the beginning. During flu season each year, while many of my colleagues wipe down their entire exam room with Clorax after each visit and wear masks while they see flu + patients, I do not. The mask makes me feel too separate. We will be fine, I kept telling people has COVID started to creep into our realities. Relax. Eat a little dirt once in a while and you will be better for it. My invincibility complex rearing its head. I was so wrong. Now, I read an \"in memoriam\" list of healthcare providers who have died from COVID that pops up on my news feed. I am overwhelmed, fixated on their names and ages. Okay, I'm scared. I am a patient and a doctor. I have MS and am on a medication that is messing with my immune system. Does this put me at increased risk? My neurologist says no, as long as my white blood cell count remains normal. Does he really know? I'm not sure. When I stop to reflect, I realize that my long-held shield of invincibility is ridiculous, a defense to protect me from the fact that I am actually already broken, as I guess we all are. How is it that I think I am unstoppable even though I already have a degenerative neurologic condition with no cure? It is almost humorous. Today, my shield has a crack in it. I worry about leaving my children without a mother, fleetingly. Regardless, I want to go to work. I am staffing one of the new RICs, or Respiratory Illness Clinics, at my hospital. We are seeing some very sick patients, because you can't even get in the door unless you have symptoms suggestive of COVID and are somehow high risk--old, frail, otherwise sick. But weirdly I feel safe. I have on my mask and my goggles, my gown and my gloves. We have protocols. We have awareness and fear, and this fear is helping to keep us safe. But it feels weird to be afraid of my patients. I internally cringe when one of them takes off his mask to blow his nose. Don't look in their throats, I am told! If you think they might have strep throat, give them an antibiotic. Everything is upside down and backwards. But I still feel somehow sheltered from the truth of this pandemic. Boston has not yet been hit by the surge. I am not seeing the patients who are intubated in the ED. I am not seeing patients extubated in the ICU, often alone, when continued treatment becomes futile. I am not seeing the bodies. I have not yet been personally touched. No one I love has died. Yet. I am still standing on the sidelines to some extent, even though I am not. This makes me feel a little guilty, like Ishouldbe feeling the piercing pain. I can no longer say I am not a germaphobe. I came as close as I ever have to a panic attack the other day in the supermarket. I was in New. Hampshire, which is behind Boston in terms of COVID awareness. I walk in unprepared. No one seems aware of the rules. No hand sanitizer anywhere. No crowd control or distancing. No wipes to clean the handles of the carts. Even the bathroom is out of order so I can't wash my hands. I have to touch the food, the credit card reader, my credit card, the cart, the bags, the steering wheel of my car. My hands are contaminated, the enemy, and I wonder if I can trust them. I want to get away from myself, but I can't. Annie Brewster,MD is an internal medicine physician in Boston. She is the founder and executive director of Health Story Collaborative.

    "data": "I'm a photographer and multidisciplinary artist whose work centers around the idea that sharing stories and making art about potentially isolating experiences can help make those experiences less lonely. I map experiences that many of us share, but don't always talk about. I'm currently working on an evolving art project about bereavement called Grief Landscapes, in which I'm documenting the wide variety of ways that people respond to loss. First, I'm inviting people to answer a series of questions about how they grieved after someone's death. I'm then photographing, in extreme close-up, something that evokes the memory of the person who died, transforming it into an abstract landscape inspired by the person's grief story. Grief is often described as a journey, but it's an intensely individual and often isolating one: rarely do people speak openly about the range of ways of grieving, and there seem to be many misconceptions about the grief process. I'm using the project to examine a number of questions about grief and bereavement: What does it look like? How do people navigate it differently? How does grief change us? Grief Landscapes documents grief not as a prescribed set of steps or timelines but as a place where there are no right answers, just an exploration of new territory. You can live anywhere in the world to participate in Grief Landscapes, and I'm looking for contributors of all ages and backgrounds, with different relationships to the deceased, and different lengths of time since the loss. To view the project so far and submit your story, go togrieflandscapes.com. Grief Landscapes is supported by a grant from the Ontario Arts Council. Mindy Stricke is a multidisciplinary artist creating photographs, interactive installations, conversations and collaborations.

    "data": "By Andrea Gilats It was August, a month past my seventy-fifth birthday and time for my annual mammogram. Though I have had annual mammograms for twenty-five years, I always fear them because I feel intensely anxious while awaiting the results. During the day or two following the procedure, I keep an ear tuned to my phone in case the dreaded call comes, and after that, I continue to feel on edge until the all-clear email arrives. Twice in the past two decades I have been sent for ultrasound examinations of my right breast, but both were in response to something my doctors felt, rather than something seen on a mammogram. Neither exam showed an irregularity, but each helped me feel luckier than I felt before I was tested. I cannot help but compare the sensation to the high one feels when an excruciating toothache, perhaps caused by an infected wisdom tooth, is relieved by a good dentist. Seventy-five marks the age at which some health experts suggest that women who are at average risk of breast cancer may no longer benefit from mammograms. I turned to Google, that indiscriminate portal of sources, and learned that the American Cancer Society says that mammogram screenings \"should continue as long as a woman is in good health and is expected to live at least ten more years.\" On the other hand, the United States Preventative Services Task Force, which offers health care providers, governmental entities, and members of the public guidance on whether or not to undergo a variety of procedures and tests, says that because of insufficient evidence, it cannot determine the balance of benefits and harms associated with mammography in women seventy-five and older. In other words, they would have no ill effect on health no matter how much longer the affected women lived. I did not have a mammogram during the inaugural year of the coronavirus pandemic, but in 2021, after being vaccinated against covid 19, I decided, albeit halfheartedly, to have one. All might have been well except that my discomfort with mammograms was not the only diagnostic decision I faced as I aged. Several years ago, my primary care doctor asked me if I would like a free CT (computerized tomography) scan of my lungs because I am a former smoker. The idea was to \"catch something\" in its asymptomatic early stages. Rather than being strictly diagnostic, it was precautionary. Rather than being preventive, it was--how best to characterize this?-- informational, like a baseline mammogram. It took me no time to answer in the negative. I did not want to know if I had a lung tumor then, and I do not want to know now unless absolutely necessary. What if I had had that scan and been diagnosed with an untreatable cancer? How would it have felt to live with that diagnosis knowing that I was helpless against it, as my late husband did? My remaining time on Earth would have been a death watch, whether for a few months or a few years. Living with such knowledge is also a death knell to optimism: it crushes well-being and kills the spirit even as the body continues to function. As it turns out, in old age, ignorance can sometimes be bliss. Before I quit smoking, I was so afraid of having a chest x-ray or CT scan of my lungs that when I did need to visit a doctor, I scrupulously hid the fact that I smoked, including lying on questionnaires. This meant that for the first sixty-one years of my life, I never underwent an x- ray or scan of my lungs. That run ended in 2006 when what turned out to be an emphysema exacerbation landed me in the emergency room of United Hospital, St. Paul, Minnesota's largest. There I suffered through a botched CT scan, which was followed by a successful PET (positron emission tomography) scan that revealed emphysema, but no tumors. I have not had an x-ray or scan of my lungs since, and never will again unless I am convinced that there is a compelling reason why an image of my lungs would be of consequential benefit to me. Truth be told, I was so afraid of invasive examinations and uncomfortable tests that I did not have regular physical exams until I was almost fifty years old. My doctor-free life came to an end one morning in the spring of 1995, when I awakened feeling so dizzy that I could not sit up. Never before and never since has my head whirled so violently for so long without letting up. In an amazing coincidence of true love, my husband awoke the same morning with his left ankle so swollen that he could not step into his work boots. Though each step burned, he could still walk, so he took charge. After feeding me some Advil, he called my insurance provider's clinic, told them my tale of dizzy woe, and made an appointment for me at two o'clock that afternoon. After that, he called his healthcare clinic, which was then known simply as the \"industrial clinic.\" Come right away, he was told, so he got dressed and off he went in his moccasins. When he returned an hour and a half later, I was still in bed, unable to move my head. Thankfully, he had received a steroid injection to calm the swelling caused by a \"mild sprain,\" and he was already feeling better. He gave me more Advil, took me to the bathroom, held my head as I emptied my bowels, steadied me as I brushed my teeth, and delivered me back into bed, where I rested for another hour or so. When it was time to leave for my doctor's appointment, he dressed me, bundled me into my jacket, walked me to the car, and secured my seat belt around me. At the clinic, a female doctor with an eastern European accent listened to my heart and took my blood pressure: 210 over 110. Heaven help me! With a dangerous bang, I had arrived in middle age. Luckily, by the time I entered the doctor's office, my headache was subsiding somewhat, which allowed me to open my awareness to the enormous fish I would now have to fry. There and then, I was given medication to reduce my blood pressure, along with two prescriptions for hypertension medications that I would take for the rest of my life. I had avoided the common symptoms of hypertension for months, even years, by attributing my frequent headaches, heart palpitations, and relentless anxiety to work-related stress. Now, all of a sudden, I knew that stress alone could not account for the turmoil inside my body. Within two weeks, I was free of all these discomforts, but out of that scare had come new obligations. Just in time for my fiftieth birthday, I now had a duty to see my female doctor every three months in order to monitor my blood pressure, thereby averting a stroke, and, at her insistent recommendation, to undergo the gynecological examinations that would help me avoid a cornucopia of women's cancers as I aged. In one afternoon, I became educated. I am neither ashamed nor proud of my ignorance; I offer my lesson here because it is one of the most salient truths about my health journey into old age: that it is a voyage that begins sooner and lasts longer than I could have imagined.

    "data": "On March 19, 1991, Larry Brennan broke his neck. He was 18 years old and suddenly paralyzed. He's had to use a wheelchair ever since. At the time of the accident, Larry was a freshman at the University of Massachusetts Amherst; he was in the Bahamas with friends on spring break. The details of the accident are fuzzy, he says, because he was intoxicated at the time, having been on a \"booze cruise\" all day. He remembers running down the beach, then nothing else. According to his friends, Larry dove into the water. The impact broke his cervical spine. Initially, when his friends saw him lying face down in the water, they assumed he was snorkeling, and it was several minutes before they realized he was in trouble. He wasn't breathing when they pulled him out. One of his friends knew CPR, and working with the others, tried to resuscitate him until the ambulance came. Larry coughed up sea water and started to breathe again, but his heart stopped and restarted numerous times before help arrived. Larry was raised in Wakefield, Massachusetts. In high school, he was a popular, 6-foot-4-inch athlete. He played football and tennis, became an accomplished skier and had many friends. As a freshman at UMass, he was flourishing, and his spring break trip was a highlight. The accident damaged his spinal cord at the C 5-6 level, basically his lower neck, leaving him a quadriplegic (meaning he has weakness in all four limbs). He can move his shoulders and his upper arms, but not his fingers, and he's completely paralyzed from the upper chest down, with total weakness in his core trunk muscles and legs. However, Larry's injury is considered \"incomplete\" in that his sensory nerve fibers were spared and his sensation is intact. For this, he feels lucky. Here, Larry talks about coming to terms with his injury and learning to live a productive, happy life -- though one he says he wouldn't wish upon anyone else. He finished college at UMass Boston six years after his injury. Now, he lives alone with his service dog Emmie, and gets help from a home aide. He works full time as a Senior Development Officer at Massachusetts General Hospital; goes on dates, skis and sails, and still hangs out with his high school buddies. As Larry puts it, \"the biggest thing for me is that I live a full and active life -- similar to how my life would have been had I not been injured. Now, I can't walk, but this is not so important to me anymore. I care most about my relationships with friends and family, staying active and having fun.\" In meeting Larry, I realized how little I understood about quadriplegia before our interaction. I never really stopped to consider the day-to-day challenges that someone in this situation faces, and the tremendous strength that it takes to overcome these obstacles. Moreover, meeting Larry has made me think about how our fears of the unknown can hinder true and genuine connection in life. When I first met Larry, I was nervous, checking myself, wondering how to be. Should I try to shake his hand or will this make him uncomfortable? Should I offer him food and drink during our meeting or will that be too hard? And so on. Larry has taught me that it is better to just ask, to be direct, and not to let these mundane, functional issues get in the way. Larry has no hang ups about these things, so why should I? We just do some things differently, and that's all.

    "data": "In the weeks leading up to the 25th anniversary of theAmericans with Disabilities Act(ADA) on July 26, social media was abuzz with disability stories. The National Museum of American History even organized an international Twitter conversation on#DisabilityStoriesonJuly 15, 2015. For theremarkably successfuldaylong event, people from across the globe engaged in conversations about representations of disability in art and popular culture, the lived experience of disability, and historical accounts and artifacts. For people with disabilities and disability rights advocates, this anniversary occasions both celebration and reflection. Accessible spaces, biomedical technology, and assistive services have made the world a more habitable place for people with disabilities. At Boston College, where I attend school, student have rallied around the cause of disability, fighting for a campus as accessible as it is beautiful.The Disability Awareness Committee of Boston Collegehas made accessibility acritical issue on campus, documenting the ways in which the built environment and institutional policies at Boston College--for instance, steep pathways marked as wheelchair accessible--disempower them. Disability advocates in Boston marked the anniversary with acelebration in Boston Common. The ADA has been a remarkable success, but we must not forget the work left to do. William Peace, who attended the event, perhaps sums it up best: \"[The ADA] has succeeded legally, but socially it has a long way to go.\" Securing the civil rights of and equal opportunities for these citizens is, bottom line, an issue of representation. People with disabilities are daily disempowered and isolated by institutions and individuals that pass over, erase, or ignore the realities of disability. It happens when a conference is held in an inaccessible building. It happens when a path is marked as accessible but is, in fact, unnavigable. It happens when avision resources workstationprovides no resources, when the sign for the workstation isn't even in braille. People with disabilities are often invisible in some parts of everyday life, such as in the workplace. In2012, only 33.5% of working-age people with disabilities were employed.In the media and popular culture, individuals with disabilities appear less often than able-bodied individuals. When they do appear, their portrayals are oftenlimited. The unflagging stigma and underrepresentation of disability halts the progress of the ADA. If people with disabilities continue to be forgotten or perceived in problematic ways, then the ADA will fail to achieve its ultimate goals of accessibility and inclusion. Stories are the answer to this crisis of representation. Which stories get told and how those stories are circulated determine how disability is understood socially and culturally. We need to move away from disability as burden and the \"super-crip\" stereotype. While these two overarching narratives seem compassionate or inspiring, they both portray disability as a tragedy, and life with a disability as inferior and unsatisfying. Disability cannot be reduced to a single narrative of pity, overcoming, or empowerment. Disability, as with all lived experience, is complex, multi-faceted, rich, individual. It resists a single story. As a society, we should listen more to the stories of individuals with disabilities. To the stories of their everyday life, of their successes and their struggles, the minutiae and the monumental moments. Disability is an innumerable range of stories--told, retold, to be told. Telling stories of disability is vital to making visible and giving voice to individuals with disabilities. Hearing stories is a way of acknowledging the reality of disability and empowering people with disabilities. By acknowledging similarities, differences, and singularities, we connect ourselves with stories. So let's keep sharing #DisabilityStories beyond the 25th anniversary of the ADA. The success of the ADA is about more than ramps, web accessibility, or public services. It's about making everyday life accessible, inclusive, and fulfilling to people with disabilities. It's about changing our attitudes and assumptions toward disability once and for all.",

    "data": "By Ella The luminous natural light shining into my all-white shower illuminates a heavenly gaze onto my bleeding, blistered body. I wouldn't consider myself particularly religious, but today I'm certain there's a divine presence holding me upright as I feebly fight for stability. Today my open wounds leave a sea of crimson dancing down the drain, my neck frozen straight to combat the blaring whiplash. Today I believe in God. Earlier, a pouring shower of glass had left me concussed and upside down. It was a tranquil roller-coaster ride, a seemingly peaceful experience as my body ascended and accepted the force. Constantly burdened by an intrusive inner monologue, I was surprisingly soothed by the sharp dissociation. It was a near-death car crash, but somehow one of the most relaxing experiences of my life. My life had been spared by a 1999 tow truck housing an unbelievably rare interior design that ultimately guarded my life. The sight of the truck alone was enough to send people at the scene into hysterics. I gather when a car looks like that, you are supposed to die. The eccentric EMT called it a miracle. God called it a favor. I call it my most bittersweet memory. Vacantly wiping the blood away, I am surreally empty as I shower. This is new for me, the chronic overthinker staring into the distance with sullen eyes. I hyper-fixate on the ceiling as I shower, void of meaning. Without any medication in my system, my dazed reflection acts as the most potent narcotic. It's bewildering how fast life ebbs and flows. Just a month earlier, the suffocatingly humid air of Miami smelled like success and teen spirit. Up until a few days before, my mother had ardently refused to let me go, exclaiming how ridiculous and unsafe it was. We were 17. I agreed, even then. But I craved it, longing for the exhilaration of me and my friends dancing in the sun and acting older than we actually were. It all seemed so grand. Suddenly, my friends were discussing reservations at trendy restaurants without a mention of going anywhere other than Miami. That must be why my mother caved on her own accord, quietly pulling up the airfare for that weekend while weakly uttering \"I don't want you to miss out\". Quickly, all my savings were down the drain, and I was packing my yellow polka-dot bikini in a small, battered carry-on. On our first night there, we shuffled back to our hotel rooms eager to prolong the night. We energetically jumped on the massive white bed in our way-too-short dresses. My head hit the ceiling, and I rolled around laughing as background music roared on. It felt like a scene from an unrealistic teen drama, and I joyfully thanked my lucky stars I had made it. After everyone went back to their room, I got in bed eager to doze off. It was close to 2 AM, and I stared vacantly into the darkness to calm my body. My inner monologue flowed relentlessly, only exciting my nerves to stay up. There was a creeping void inside my stomach that only seemed to grow as it got later and later. My strange uneasiness was only fueled as I began to fixate on time, physically feeling as if I was going to run out of seconds. Or out of air, as my chest tightened and the butterflies in my stomach sharpened their wings. I felt viciously hot as every manual breath stung my diaphragm. The heaviness weighing on me forced me to take large gulps, choking to find whatever air was left in my lungs. Laying immobile, I silently prayed for my well-being. My breath finally came back after what felt like hours, and I looked at the time. It was 4:37 AM. I then laid awake all night in an anxious, stomach-severing, pit of nerves. Finally, when the sun rose, I got out of bed nonchalantly to put on sunscreen and my yellow polka-dot bikini. I had just had my first panic attack (and certainly not my last) in a beautiful hotel room overlooking the beach. Yawning profusely from my lack of sleep, I didn't tell anyone about my nightmare of a night. I assured myself nothing was wrong while consciously sequestering any sentiments of anxiety. Miami was picture-perfect, and I tried to be as well. Later that month, my body felt uneasy during the most celebratory of times. When I blew out my candles on my 18th birthday cake, my dad reminded me to \"make a wish!\" Every year I wished for the happiness and health of me and my loved ones, taking a moment to relish the warmth of those around me. But this year, my mood regressed sourly as I thought about the ways happiness and especially health can regress. An intrusive chain of thoughts urged me to think about growing older and the possibility of death waiting mercilessly around the corner. As I eat my chocolate cake, that familiar pit-like sensation returns to my stomach. I try to push it to the deepest parts of my being, wondering if it's inherently selfish to ruin your own happiness. It was in these moments that I always seemed to think of God the most, specifically when I needed something. I was the equivalent of that friend who only comes around when she has a bad breakup, forgetting about you when there's a new swooning love interest. I now think I was rather human, which doesn't equate to a \"get out of jail free card\" but is certainly worth something. A month later, my parents prayed when I was in the hospital. I wonder if the people on the street had also prayed when they saw the utter collapse of the 1999 pickup truck. Even if they were selfless in their desires, they still wanted something. It's rather ironic. When my cuts sting in the shower, I do not feel the sentiment of needing anything. I grasp desperately for emotion or even words, without tangibly holding anything. And there it is. A subtle juxtaposition to all that I have ever known; a dissonance in the looming anxiety that had gradually piled up. Like a weatherman, I had lived life constantly dreading the storm, overanalyzing every mere drizzle of rain. But now it had rained and poured, and I was burnt out from caring at all. My minimal stability is jolted by a robusttap on the shower curtain. In my drowsy state, I cannot comprehend why my kitten is staring into my shower with bright blue eyes. My cat enhances my sense of disbelief, perching herself on the shower ledge and focusing her gaze on me. All of a sudden, I can't look away from the disturbing pool of blood juxtaposing the beautiful white marble shower. I realize the severity of the situation, the bitter truth separating before and after. I realize I'm in the after, because my body is gashed and there's broken glass everywhere. Upon seeing my kitten in the shower there's a silent catharsis. The shower covers the sounds as I begin to cry, naked and exposed. As cold tears pour, I mourn all the moments I shed away in worry. As if accepting my survival could take back all my previous doubts, I feel somber clarity. The anxiety reaching its peak throughout the last few months suddenly halts, seeming trivial now in the scope of things. I ask myself what it was all for, the stream of constant anxiety that has progressively plagued me. Now the coin had flipped, and my worst anxieties had come true. What now? Will my fear of everything rise like the tide, or will it flow back and retreat? I'm not sure who I am with a constant rain cloud hanging over me. Maybe I'm lucky enough to have things worth missing, desires worth yearning for. I suddenly noticed my cat's brown fur was soaked from the shower's stream. She stays put, a strange phenomenon for felines who are typically hydrophobic. Somehow this validates that there's a plan for me, more life left ahead. I think about God and all those times I anxiously craved something beyond minor. It's funny now as I delicately extract glass shards out of my hair. I wonder how many people prayed in the hospital at the same time as my parents. I wonder if those prayers were more genuine, more emotionally volatile than the ones in church. I implore myself to be better than I have been as the cold water sinks deeper into my open cuts. I reminisce on everything I'm grateful for, everything that has continuously gone right when I worried it wouldn't. At this very moment, I don't feel like I need anything, for I am overcome by gratitude. I simply put my face under the cold tap to reinvigorate my feeling of being alive. Then, I put my hands together because this seems like a good time to pray. About the Author Ella is a third-year student at Northeastern University, studying psychology and behavioral neuroscience.

    "data": "By Emily Cheng The air in my parents' restaurant is hot and greasy and always loud, but that is how they know it is good. I first stepped into the restaurant when I was ten and didn't know anything. My parents were owners of a Chinese restaurant, and I didn't even know what a wok was. They brought me in to \"work\" when they couldn't find a grandparent or uncle to watch over me. I would sit by my mother and do the simplest tasks, packing white and brown rice into Chinese takeout containers. With every container I finished, she would tell me \"not enough, more, more.\" Then, she would take the container out of my hands, scoop triple the amount I had filled, and pack it with the rice bursting out of the paper box. She would always give more rice than I thought we could afford. When it was not so busy, I eyed the chefs who held large metal woks and tossed food with them like it was nothing. I would learn that these woks were the key to a real Chinese restaurant. They needed special care--constantly seasoned in oil and heat to producewok hei, the breath of the wok. Over the shouting of my mother and chefs in the kitchen was the sound of oil sputtering and popping at the addition of washed green scallions. I had convinced myself that this was the wok breathing life into food. And in this same way, the woks' air would season the whole kitchen--its staff, the walls of the restaurant, and the greasy floors--imbuing itself into everything. *** In mid-October, my father called to tell me that they have decided to sell the restaurant and have found a buyer. They've spoken about it a few times, but it was something so distant it didn't seem real. \"I just wanted to let you know.\" So simple, unsentimental. I didn't have enough time to think of an answer for him, so I only began to process after he hung up.Did we have enough money to live?It was the most obvious question, and I hope they had thought this through.How much was the restaurant?But more accurately,how can you assign a price to this?Overnight, everyone had seemingly become hard and unemotional when all I could do was feel. Feel for all the stories unaccounted for. *** My father remembers his childhood at the restaurant as the worst time in his life. It is a Chinese tradition that the oldest son is the one who will suffer the most. He was the one to care for his younger siblings and the only sibling expected to help in the restaurant, tasked to hold the family together while his parents worked in the kitchen downstairs. After high school, he would return to the restaurant and help my grandmother take orders at the front. My grandmother, overwhelmed with stress and responsibilities, would verbally lash out at him in front of customers and the entire kitchen staff.Good for nothing! Stupid! Worse than garbage!Words to that effect. Words my father could not believe a parent could say to their child. When my grandparents retired, they urged him to take it over; they saw it as the greatest gift they could pass down. And as the oldest son, my father could not refuse. Traumatized by his childhood, my father spent nearly the next 40 years working at the restaurant. He has worked through countless invoices and business statements until he physically could not handle seeing numbers anymore. He started taking medication to help him through this, but eventually it stopped helping. At his lowest point, he stood at the top of the third floor of the restaurant office and attempted. I remember my father before this time. He would come home and play with us and smile. He was so happy to just be with us, in the moment, alive. He has never been like that since. He had survived, but some part of him had died in the restaurant many years ago.\\ *** Now, he's cleaning up the mess from the past 50 years. He has been moving out his sister's old books and his parent's picture frames. As much as the restaurant has hurt him, his texts to our family group chat read a bittersweet. \"Today I realized Cleaning out 30 years worth of stuff is quite exhausting.\" The second floor of the restaurant is an office that looks more like a dump. It is a collection of everything discarded, but not thrown away. My father sends us a picture he's found of him and my grandfather in the clutter of that office. It's him as a kid. My grandfather has on a yellow polo, one arm wrapped around my father, wearing a matching polo in white. I don't recognize my grandfather in this picture, but they're both smiling. And for some reason, I find myself zooming on the icee my father is holding because seeing him as a kid brings out something so sad in me that I don't want to feel it. All I can see now are his tiny fingers gripping onto a paper cup. *** My mother has no fears. While my father works in accounting, my mother works in the kitchen, in the fire. She comes home with cuts and blisters. I'll ask if she's ok, if it's painful, if she can still go back to work. She won't give it the slightest attention. \"It's not anything.\" Her hands are not rough, but strong, necessary to push woks, withstand burns, and raise children. She was like this even before I was born. When my mother was pregnant with my older brother, she continued to work in the restaurant. She called orders and cooked and sweated in the humid New York summer air. For one order, it required lobster which they had not prepared that day. My mother, big-bellied but still strong, walked downstairs to the restaurant's inventory to start preparing the ingredients. On the way, a coworker bumped into her, and she fell one flight of stairs down to the bottom. My mother was rushed to the hospital by my father who had already started grieving. When she was told she and the baby were fine, she had taken that day off, then returned to the restaurant the day after. She kept working all the way to August, until the moment before her water broke. *** My mother has spoken with the Chinese man buying our restaurant and his lawyer. She's been managing stipulations, lawyers, contracts, and all the things that she does not understand. And she feels herself getting older and smaller, fading into a shadow of her past self. \"You are in such a good place. To have perfect American English.\" I can type these words, understand the nuances of English words, and find beauty in the language. But when she tries to negotiate with the lawyer, she gets pulled aside and her English is called \"childish\"--like she is playing games by changing her mind, but it is only that she is unable to explain her thoughts in American words. She tells me this is what happens when you are bad at English. For so long, I've been trying to learn Mandarin, but even with Sunday Chinese school, textbooks, and living in a Mandarin-speaking family, my fluency is still that of an elementary school student. Sometimes, I think about all the stories my mom wants to tell me but can't. All the words that she knows in her perfect Chinese, the three dialects--Mandarin, Cantonese, and Fuzhounese--she's fluent in. I know she is not a shadow of who she was. She is only waiting in the shadows, holding onto the words she knows. She is biding her time, planning her moves, and learning her options in an American world. And when she's ready, she'll strike. *** I am angry at myself for wanting to hold onto the restaurant. For even feeling sentimental towards leaving it behind. It has been the source of my parents' despair for decades. I should really be celebrating, cheering, and jumping at the idea of it never being in our lives again. Leave it somewhere far, far away. For too long it has been a mass, growing and growing, becoming unbearable and draining my parents. Cut out a pound of the flesh that feeds on the pain of good people. Cut out this tumor. But as much as it has hurt, it has supported three generations of my family. It is my grandparents' true first-born, and my parents' entire lives. As I'm going back home to see the restaurant for the last time, I am going to indulge in the gluttony, filling myself with the pain, hurt, love, death, and ends of my moments being there. It's like I'm gripping onto a broken wok, seeing all of its scratches and imperfections, and trying to learn to let it go. I know using it will break it--the shards recutting the wounds of my family. So once more. Before I go, I'll oil it one last time, give it heat, give it breath, give back all it has given to us. In return, we'll slowly learn to move on and learn to feel the way it has breathed into our family new life.

This defines the social and biological construct we call disease, and our mission to change it defines us as physicians. 4/nBut it hurts. And so we learn to pretend that we are somehow separate from it. 5/nWe can even compartmentalize moments of joy, which is tragic. Because there's always the next patient, the next moment to face without prejudice, with the illusion of a clean slate. 6/nI remember running a code on an older gentleman as a resident.

My co-resident noted that it was pizza day. We high-fived. 8/nI immediately felt sick to my stomach. I was ashamed. Because I knew that I was changing.

    "data": "by Emmett Lyman I grew up in a small town in central Connecticut with a family that loved the outdoors. In the early years of my development we spent our free time traveling, backpacking, camping, and exploring the world around us. When I was 13 years old my Boy Scout troop scheduled a day of rock climbing at a nearby cliff, in all honesty just a large glacial erratic boulder in the woods. It was my first time climbing a rock and using rope systems for safety. I was tentative at first, but as I began to climb I realized that it felt natural to me, like something that was pre-destined to be part of my life. I spent the day climbing around on the moderate terrain, certainly not doing anything that would be considered legitimate rock climbing to a serious adventurer, but at the time it felt like the opening chapter of a book that was entirely new to me, and it drew me in. Seeing a photograph of my young self from that day, I'm now aware of just how easy the challenge was and how utterly silly I looked with poor form, laughable equipment, and little to no inherent skill. But the smile pasted across my face showcased a newfound love of the sport. I still remember the feel of rock touching my fingertips, my shoes edging to support my body weight on small ledges and cracks, and the thrill of weighting the fixed rope as I leaned back to rappel down the rock face for the very first time. Many years later, my path had turned away from climbing as I'd moved to Boston and prioritized other things like furthering my education and career, fixing cars and motorcycles, and even playing golf, which is a sport about as far away from climbing as you can get. While I was at a posh training program in Miami one day, my best friend Pat called out of the blue and asked if I'd like to take a rock climbing class with him. Little did I realize at the time that he'd stirred a long dormant, but ever-present passion deep within me. Together we became engrossed in climbing and the climbing community, and we both knew it would remain with us for life. Still, other priorities continued to guide my path. I was pursuing a career in business as I worked diligently to pay off grad school loans, and I moved to Washington DC following a beautiful and brilliant girl that I'd fallen deeply in love with. However, it wasn't long before I found myself in someone else's city, abandoned with a shattered heart. I fell into a terrible depression far from friends and family. It's strange to reflect that now, years later and after a life-changing injury, this loss remains the most painful event of my life. Pat and other climbing friends from my prior life in Boston desperately supported me across time and distance as loneliness threatened to consume me. One August weekend, two very close friends, a couple named Alissa and John, invited me up to one of our favorite climbing areas in the New York Catskill region. This wasn't unusual, as we came to this climbing mecca regularly given its similar distance from our two cities. This time, however, they secretly invited Lauren, a girl I'd never met, in hopes that we might connect with each other. I climbed that weekend with John, and Lauren climbed with Alissa. The cliff extends for miles through the forest with thousands of established climbing routes, so when we bumped into each other at the base of a route that was well away from the more popular areas, it was undoubtedly an orchestrated encounter. Lauren's eyes caught mine with a shy smile, and I smiled back feeling an immediate spark of attraction. We exchanged pleasantries, and then John and I carried on down the trail. Once out of earshot, John nudged me with a grin and asked \"She has a great rack, doesn't she?\" The double entendre referred to the rack of climbing equipment that Lauren carried on her harness as she prepared to lead Alissa up their next objective, and it was indeed nice. But the crass and uncharacteristic joke from my strait-laced friend left us both laughing like teenagers. Lauren and I chatted at length during a group dinner that night, and quickly made plans for a climbing date a couple weeks later. My friends' gambit worked, and I soon found myself smitten once more, eagerly searching for an avenue to leave my painful memories in Washington for another new beginning in Boston with Lauren. Within a few months I convinced my employer to let me to work remotely, still a rare feat in those pre-pandemic times. It wasn't long before we were living together surrounded by friends and the climbing community that we both loved so much. Three years later, Alissa, John, Lauren, and I had grown inseparable and we climbed together all over the world. We decided to plan something new for the warm summer solstice of 2018, and set our sights on an unexplored region of the Alaska Range of mountains. We'd spent years honing our skills in established climbing areas, where guide books describe all the difficulties and solutions to well-trodden routes up rock faces, and in familiar mountain ranges teeming with tourist hikers following trail markers toward known summits and vistas. We felt it was time to take a step into the realm of exploration, a pursuit that is slowly disappearing from the toolbox of many mountaineers as more and more of the world's finite hidden wilderness areas are explored. Our plan was to find an inspiring mountain that no person had ever climbed or seen before and establish a new route to the top. A close friend and mentor of ours had built his young climbing career doing expeditions like this throughout Alaska in the 1960s and 70s, and he helped us plan for the inevitable hardships we would face. Following months of preparation, a tiny bush plane dropped us off two at a time on a narrow gravel strip in the middle of an uncharted river deep in the sub-range aptly called the Hidden Mountains of Lake Clark National Park. We portaged hundreds of pounds of food and equipment through thick groves of alders and underbrush, following the river toward its glacial origin and a line of distant jagged peaks erupting from the earth. After several days of thrashing through unforgiving terrain, we discovered a small glacier ringed by a cirque of stone towers that we surveyed together for promising climbing routes. We settled on our target, a twin-spired peak we dubbed Mt. Sauron. After hunkering down for two days in camp to wait out unpredictable Alaska storms we awoke to promising weather and gathered up our equipment. We snowshoed across the glacier to the cliff face and began to climb by two different routes, both couples venturing into the unknown. I remember feeling utter euphoria as I quested up through virgin rock with no knowledge of what awaited me above, finding my own way in a manner I'd never done before. I was finally blending the physical challenge of rock climbing with the heightened mental challenge of unlocking a puzzle to find the best solution. It was the happiest day of climbing I ever experienced. Unfortunately, this is where memory fails me. Sometime late in the day, about two thirds of the way up the cliff, the objective hazard that always looms in the mountains came for me. I was struck by falling rock, either let loose by the sun's warming rays on frozen terrain far above me or perhaps pulled down by my own negligence as I climbed. We think the rock snapped my head back, slamming my rigid foam helmet into the back of my neck and partially severing my spinal cord at the C6 vertebra. What followed was an extraordinary rescue by my close friends, as well as a unit of elite military parajumpers that navigated a Pave Hawk helicopter at breakneck speed hundreds of miles from Anchorage and through the unfamiliar mountain range. Several weeks later, I woke from a deep and bizarre dream state that I later learned was an induced coma to find myself in the Intensive Care Unit at Providence Hospital in Anchorage. The rockfall had caused a traumatic brain injury, and the coma was my best chance of avoiding total loss of higher function following brain surgery. Over the ensuing weeks, I was visited almost constantly by my climbing team, Pat and his family, who had flown up from Rhode Island, and many members of my own family from Connecticut and nearby Juneau. They had all rushed to Anchorage when my neurosurgeon advised them to get there as quickly as possible so they could say goodbye. I proved to be luckier than he expected and survived to discover a new and different type of life. As the fog gently lifted, it was hard to differentiate between the strange sea of dreams my mind invented to conceal its inability to grapple with the trauma, and the new unfamiliar reality that I was waking to. The sterile intensive care setting, the unknown faces of my medical team, and an unfamiliar detachment between my body and mind left the real world feeling as distant as the dream world I'd been inhabiting for weeks. The first two years with a spinal cord injury I felt like a very different person, and at times it seemed as though my very humanity had been stripped away. I felt weak, confused, and entirely dependent on others. Following twelve weeks of rehab at Spaulding Hospital in Boston, where my extensive injuries kept me from making significant progress, Lauren and I moved to an apartment across the street from the facility. I enrolled in an aggressive regimen of outpatient therapy, but still made little progress. Meanwhile, in my confused state I failed to see the warning signs of a pressure sore developing, and less than a year after my accident found myself bedridden for months preceding and following flap surgery to repair the damage. For Lauren, the emotional trauma of the accident itself and the unrelenting difficulty of having to care for me with painfully little reciprocity weighed heavily, and eventually it broke her spirit. She left in a gloomy cloud of mutual sadness. It felt like those early years were marked by an endless series of similar scares and setbacks, and it was difficult to see a path forward. Yet there were glimmers of hope. Shortly after recovering from the pressure sore, I got a handcycle and was thrilled to rediscover joy in the exercise, movement, and social engagement it gave me. Nine months later I took possession of a manual wheelchair, which we'd thought during my stay at Spaulding I'd never be able to operate. I immediately felt comfortable in the new chair, and came to prefer its raw simplicity to the impressive technology of my power chair. It felt more like an extension of my body and offered a more direct connection with my surroundings, similar to the way tight-fitting climbing shoes used to transform intimidating cliffs of stone into inviting playgrounds where I felt most alive. I'm only now starting to appreciate how much that direct connection has always mattered to me. When the Covid-19 pandemic struck in early 2020, my day-to-day existence was still enabled only by support from caregivers that came in the morning and evening to help with activities I was unable to do for myself. Most important among these were tasks like managing my bowel and bladder, showering, transferring to and from bed, and getting dressed. I had three caregivers on a rotating schedule, but one by one they fell ill and dropped out of service. One morning I got the dreaded phone call from the last remaining caregiver telling me that she didn't feel well and was not coming to work. I was trapped in bed - a catastrophe I'd hoped would never come. Terrified, I called my sister in Connecticut and she drove 2 1/2 hours to perform the caregiver role that morning. She then told me flatly that we were going to pack my bags and I was moving in with her and my three nieces for the foreseeable future. At that moment I saw one thing with perfect clarity - my single most important objective was to find a way to live independently without requiring another person to drop everything and care for me. I wanted to make sure I never again felt so exposed and vulnerable. Since that morning three years ago, I've invested all my effort into reducing my dependence on others. I tell myself that this will mean I can once again play the simple role of friend, brother, or son rather than patient. I'm plagued by the memory of being stuck in bed without the ability to rescue myself, like a formative childhood trauma that haunts me years later. My journey has taken me to rehab centers across the country to learn new skills, through medical procedures to simplify my care needs, and into several housing arrangements where I experimented with ideas on how to adapt my environment to my disability. I solved one small challenge at a time, and I'm fortunate that the unique characteristics of my injury have allowed me to achieve real independence and with it the confidence that I won't again feel trapped or abandoned. The sad irony is that by working so hard to achieve self-reliance and protect myself from being abandoned again, I know that in some ways I've pushed away others when they just wanted to help. A mental survey of my fellow quads throughout this community leaves me awestruck by how others have managed to emerge from their injuries to lead successful careers, start families and raise children, and give back to the disability community with endless commitment to mentorship and fellowship, all of them ways that I've fallen behind. Our injuries force us to be selective in how we invest our time, and zealous pursuit of one goal means profound trade-offs in others. No one can do it all. I wonder how I'll feel about the path I chose when I look back years from now. These five years have also exposed for me a hidden truth about spinal cord injuries. While we're capable of remarkable adaptation to solve complex challenges, we're inevitably caught off guard by new and unexpected complications that often prove more difficult than the paralysis itself. In my case it's a condition called heterotopic ossification. A massive bone structure has grown to encapsulate my hip joint, distorting it in a painful way that reduces my function and disrupts the nearby organs. It's a poorly understood condition that leaves even knowledgeable clinicians with little to no appreciation for the challenges it has created. It's hard to blame them. There are only subtle indications to an observer that the torque on my skeletal structure twists me violently sideways and prevents me from lifting myself during transfers, that the constant pain emanating from my hip causes intense tone and spasms from my fingertips to my toes, and that the dysfunction of my digestive system due to unwelcome bone constricting it has warped my once healthy diet to a limited palette of liquids and a few heavily processed foods. The limitations imposed on my body have meaningfully changed how I live my life, how I view my surroundings, and how I make use of scarce resources like time and energy. Still, I see within myself a familiar spark, the core of a person that remains undamaged and unrestrained by the physical changes around it. I will never again get to climb unknown cliffs in uncharted locations, but the spirit of exploration and adaptation persists, as do my most valued friendships. I'm buoyed with confidence gleaned from the successes that I've enjoyed over the past several years. I've realized that while this disability is restrictive and unforgiving, we can still learn to live our best lives with it. By forcing us to consider what matters most, it can actually help us focus on priorities that we might otherwise have neglected. There's no cure for spinal cord injury and, strictly speaking, there's no recovery from it. But this is not a terminal condition, and it's one that can teach us to find new sources of strength and discovery. I hope that I and all my fellow members of the spinal cord injury community continue to look beyond our scares and setbacks, and unlock new routes to climb through this unknown terrain and reach the beautiful summits of our own hidden mountains.",

    "data": "An Interview with Dr. Anne Hallward By Val Walker Dr. Anne Hallward is the host and founder of Safe Space Radio and a board-certified psychiatrist in Portland, Maine. Anne's interest in difficult subjects began in her teens, when she noticed how few adults around her seemed to be talking about intimate or difficult subjects. Formerly on the faculty at Harvard Medical School and Cambridge Hospital, she designed and taught courses on death and dying, cultural competence, sexuality, and psychiatric interviewing, and has published on death and dying, cultural bias in medicine, sexuality, and hunger in the Philippines and Bangladesh. Anne is the recipient of the Ulrich B. Jacobsohn Lifetime Achievement Award from the Maine Association of Psychiatric Physicians, the Jeanne Spurlock Social Justice Award from the Association of Women Psychiatrists, and the Exemplary Psychiatrist Award from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). She has also been recognized for her work in radio with a Gracie Award for Best Host of a Local Radio Show. Anne speaks internationally on stigma and shame, traumatic silence, and voluntary vulnerability as a form of leadership. Could there be anything lonelier than not being able to talk about something terribly difficult--something that no one feels safe talking about? One of the greatest causes of social isolation is carrying the burden of stigma, shame or silence. We need safe spaces, or safe people, for sharing what is keeping us isolated and ashamed. Safe spaces are essential to breaking through the walls of isolation. I'd heard of Safe Space Radio in the years I'd lived in Maine yet had never listened to it until I moved to Boston a few years ago. Anne Hallward, a psychiatrist, was the host, so I'd wrongly assumed it was for issues about mental illness until I recently discovered it's for talking about anything that's hard to talk about. The first thing I saw on Anne's website for Safe Space Radio says it all: The show about the subjects we'd struggle with less if we could talk about them more. Heartened after reading her engagingly informative website and listening to a podcast, I reached out to her, first with an email, and then with a phone call. She graciously answered, and we spoke right away. I was grateful that Anne could take time for an in-depth conversation about what it takes to create a safe space, and how safe spaces help us break through isolation. Our conversation alone was powerful enough to give me a boost to be more courageous in \"going there\" with the topics we usually shy away from. After speaking with Anne, I have a new motto: Courage is contagious. Val: Since launching Safe Space Radio in 2008, you've interviewed hundreds of guests. Though you've covered a wide range of compelling topics, has there been a common, prevailing message from all your guests through the years? Anne: Yes, there is a common message. People have a wish to turn their struggles into a gift for others. They give voice to hidden and silenced stories in order to help others. We started out with a focus on reducing the stigma of mental illness, so I talked with many people who had struggled with depression, anxiety, or addiction. Each guest wanted to share their story because they didn't want others to feel as alone as they had. They wanted to help to reduce shame and stigma. Soon we began to include a much wider range of topics including homophobia, racism, sexuality and death and dying, and each guest brought the hope that the story of their struggle could be freeing to others. Val: Because we all have a sense of what a safe space means, I would love to know what safety means to you. Anne: I used to think that safety referred to the absence of physical threat. But now I think of it more internally, as the feeling of being able to be fully oneself. A common threat to a sense of safety is shame, and the forces, both internal and external, that tell us that we are not good enough. So, safety begins inside ourselves and then extends to our personal relationships, our communities, our culture, and our nation. Safety means being able to reveal our whole selves to each other and that entails two important things: feeling able to share our vulnerability as well as our strengths. The invisibility of either side is painful, so being safe means we are free to express both parts of ourselves. For example, when thinking of refugees, we often only see their suffering and don't see their gifts. They had to flee their country, arriving here as people of color, needing help. The lens of a stereotype can blind us to their extraordinary gifts. For women, and people of color, and those with disabilities and other marginalized identities, safety is not only about honoring difference and vulnerability, it is about seeing and respecting strength. Sharing our vulnerabilities as well as our gifts also applies to the topic of asking for help. I've learned from my guests that we avoid asking for help because we are afraid that our needs will define us. We fear that people will only know us through our needs or vulnerabilities. Indeed, if either our gifts or our vulnerabilities are invisible, it's very painful. If I trust that you can hold both sides of me in your mind, and we can fully know each other--then that's what safety means. Val: I've never thought of safety in that way--to be able to show our vulnerabilities as well as our gifts. So, when you have a guest on your show sharing a painful ordeal in her life that was stigmatized and shamed, her strengths still shine through. But, speaking of stigma, can we ever get rid of it? Anne: Erving Goffman (a well-known sociologist) says, \"Stigma is a sense of spoiled identity that you cannot wash off.\" That's why we need to share our strengths at the same time we share our vulnerabilities, so the needs don't end up defining us in a stigmatized way. We need to see each person as whole. Safe Space Radio is one public health approach to fostering greater empathy and understanding in order to reduce stigma. As the famous gay activist, Harvey Milk, once said, \"This is how the revolution will happen, one lonely teenager at a time.\" Each time someone dares to come forward publicly with a silenced story, the culture shifts incrementally. Val: Your message is powerful. But what if we are socially isolated and don't have a safe person to turn to? To confide in? Anne: Therapy has a tremendous value here. Many of us have had painful experiences of trying to share our vulnerability with someone, and feeling judged or rejected, so we might be understandably afraid to make ourselves vulnerable again and could benefit from a therapist with whom we can practice being vulnerable. Support groups are also spaces to practice being vulnerable. If there are no support groups that you feel you can belong to, then you could start your own. For example, Alyson Thompson, a biracial woman in St. Louis was struggling with feeling left out, isolated and feeling like there was nowhere she belonged. She created a monthly meet up group through Facebook, called \"Mixed Feelings\" which has attracted a large group of other biracial folks in her area. Val: That's a great name for her group. Facebook was an ideal way for Alyson to launch her group. But looking at social media overall, do you think it decreases social isolation or increases it? Anne: Social media can go both ways. It can bring people together (as it did for Alyson), but it also can be isolating because comparing ourselves to others can be a source of great loneliness. Research on social media is not my area of expertise, but social media seems to perpetuate \"in your face\" comparing of ourselves with others which can make us feel inadequate and alone. Val: What inspired you to start Safe Space Radio? Anne: From a young age, I've always been hungry to talk about the things that weren't named--topics that were avoided and kept secret. When I was in medical school doing my pediatric rotation, I watched children being held down while tubes were being put in them, and watching their distress really troubled me. Of course, these procedures were necessary and life-saving, and were done with the best intentions, but it still troubled me, and I wanted to find out more. I began doing research on this topic, as well as research with my own medical records from my childhood. I made a discovery. I found out that I was hospitalized for a serious infection as a toddler of 18 months and isolated for 10 days on an infectious disease unit. My mother had just given birth to my younger sister and was not allowed to visit me for those 10 days. This was a traumatic experience for me, and I had many nightmares throughout my childhood. Yet no one ever spoke about this. Childhood medical traumas like these are often unrecognized, because the intention of the doctor is to help the child. But from the perspective of the child, the experience may feel akin to assault. But thank goodness for my medical records, and for medical school that uncovered what had happened to me! I felt a great sense of relief that my early experiences could be named. And I felt a deep passion to humanize our patient experiences by sharing our stories. I now ask new patients about medical trauma whenever I take a trauma history, and this has brought up so many stories of suffering that the person hadn't fully understood or recognized as being legitimate trauma. I began a research project by interviewing women with a history of childhood medical procedures, measuring the long-term psychological consequences. The surprise to me was how grateful they each were to have their struggles validated, and how eager they were to let me use their stories to try to change and humanize medical practice. The experience of living with the shame of a silenced story, then discovering the power of telling it for my own healing and the healing of others inspired me to begin Safe Space Radio. Val: That is an amazing story, Anne. It must have been so frightening at 18 months old to be isolated in a hospital room, separated from your mother among strange people in white coats doing painful procedures. It's so important to tell this story. Anne: I would like to share something I learned from guests on my show about what it takes to tell our stories. I used to think my role as the host was to create a really safe space so my guests could tell their most courageous story. But over the years, I've learned that I had it backwards; it was their courage that creates that safety for others and for our listeners. Where there is safety, there is someone who has had the generosity to make it so through their own courage. When I was interviewing Ebrahim Rasool of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, he told me a story about the role that psychiatrists can play in fostering courage. He said people who had been tortured were offered an opportunity to see a psychiatrist before they gave their testimony to the commission. The role of the psychiatrist was to foster their courage, to help them tell their story and give voice to their silenced trauma. He called this the work of \"en-couragement.\" He told me that we should always think of the word en-courage as having a hyphen. He taught me that hearing the stories of others and being taken seriously when we dare to speak foster our courage. Courage is contagious. Learning about the meaning of en-couragement transformed my work as a clinician. An important part of my role as a psychiatrist is to foster courage. Val: It rings so true when you say courage is contagious. We can foster courage in each other by telling our stories. That's why Safe Space Radio is so powerful. I'm wondering what topics you will be covering this fall? Any new initiatives? Anne: We are now in conversations with WBUR to be our distribution partner to NPR stations nationwide. We are creating a 4-part series that covers topics that are hard to talk about. The first show is called Apologies. What do we need to make our apologies truly healing? The second show is Asking for Help. We often underestimate people's willingness to help and miss opportunities to be supported by others. Our third show is called Loneliness. How can we reduce the stigma and shame about loneliness? And finally, the fourth topic is Talking to Kids about Race and Racism. White people tend to feel awkward about this topic. How can we find useful ways to help kids understand and begin to address the disparities they see around them without reinforcing stereotypes? Val: We could learn so much from courageous conversations about these topics. Anne, you've opened my eyes about what a safe space really means and about how our stories foster courage in ourselves and one another. People like you encourage us to be brave and to speak about the unspeakable things. Thanks so much for your time today. Anne: Thank you. I enjoyed our time.

    "data": "An Interview with Robyn Houston-Bean, Founder, The Sun Will Rise Foundation By Val Walker Robyn Houston-Bean lives in Braintree, MA, and manages an insurance agency for four days a week. She is married to John Bean, a sheet metal worker, and has a daughter, Olivia, age 25, and a son, Jake, age 21. Amazingly, around her demanding business and the needs of her family, Robyn runs a dynamic, fast-growing organization, The Sun Will Rise, dedicated to serving families affected by the Opioid epidemic. Three years ago, Robyn's oldest son, Nick, died of an opioid overdose. Just one year after his death, finding a way to channel her grief, Robyn began building her foundation in honor of her son, and soon engaged hundreds of families with support groups, inspirational talks, and fundraising events. I wanted to understand how Robyn was able to express her grief through community activism, and more deeply, to explore how she found comfort, understanding and support for her grief. One grey morning in February, I enjoyed a rich, two-hour interview with Robyn. Her candid insights about how grief isolated her, and what it took to break through isolation and turn to others was a powerful story in itself. She didn't hold back from \"going there\" to describe her first devasting weeks after Nick's death. Her story is so compelling and important that I have written her interview in two parts. Part One is about how she broke out of the isolation of her grief. Part Two is about her healing adventure of developing her foundation, The Sun Will Rise. Right at the beginning of my conversation, Robyn made one thing quite clear: We don't ever \"get over\" nor completely recover from our child's death, but hopefully, we learn to live with loss--and if possible, find a sense of purpose to guide our grief. For Robyn and many who support her work, community activism for facing the opioid epidemic has given devasted people a sense of meaning, purpose and belonging. Part One: Breaking Through the Isolation of Grief Robyn didn't hold back from \"going there\" to describe her first devasting weeks after Nick's death. Val: Can you describe the early stages of your grief--starting at the point you think it's best to start? Robyn: First, I should tell you about the night before he died. I'll never forget the night before Nick overdosed. Strangely, out of the blue, before Nick came home from work, my daughter, Olivia, said, \"I have a bad feeling about him.\" As soon as he got home, he walked straight to the fridge. When Nick put his face into the fridge I made him look at me because of my daughter's feeling that something didn't seem right. I put both my hands on the sides of his face to make him look at me. I asked, \"Are you okay?\" He told me, \"I'm just tired-- I'm going to bed, why?\" I answered, \"Because I love you, and don't want anything to happen to you.\" He replied, \"I love you too. I'm tired and going to bed. I have to be up for an early shift.\" It still haunts me that I didn't know something horrible was going to happen that night. The next morning as I was headed out to the gym for my usual workout, I was surprised to see Nick's car in the driveway, as he usually drove to work on the early shift. I wondered, why was Nick's car still there? I called upstairs towards his room, \"Hey Nick, are you up there?\" It seemed so weird he was not answering as he was such an early morning kind of guy. I went to his room and found him lying motionless in his bed, cold and blue. I tried to revive him with Narcan but I could tell it was too late. I screamed a horrible, guttural sound--a sound I have never made in my life. Still, my daughter called 911. The EMT and police came and took him to the hospital, but he was gone. Val: What a horrible shock--to be the one to find him dead right at home. Before his death, had there been any signs that you sensed Nick was using again or hiding anything? Robyn: Not really. It was such a shock, and there really are no words to describe this kind of shock. He was doing so well and so proud of his new job as an Emergency Services Technician. He had just finished his certification and was feeling a real sense of purpose and mission in his life. He told me almost every day how he loved his work, and loved being so helpful for others, saving lives. But...perhaps, he saw too many awful things during emergencies and rescues, and maybe some things had triggered him. I will never really know. Val: What were those first weeks or months like for you? Robyn: Everything just stopped. I just stopped. All I could do was sit on the couch. I had always been a super-energetic person who loved fitness competitions and worked hard to be the best at anything I wanted to do. I was once the unstoppable, super-achieving woman who never looked back. But when Nick died, I didn't know how to be me anymore. Unfortunately, my husband and youngest son didn't know how to relate to this person I had become--this woman who just stopped everything. And my friends tried to text me and chat to cheer me up. But I couldn't do chit chat anymore. My daughter could understand somewhat, but she was my daughter and was grieving in her own way. For me to grieve, I needed to have some of Nick's things around me on the counter by the kitchen--his little harmonica, his coin collection, little pins he wore, his pocket knives, but this bothered my husband to the degree that this caused arguments. He didn't want to talk about the death of our son or look at Nick's stuff because he just wanted to push the memories away to get through the day. I was the total opposite from him in how I grieved. There was an awful tension between us. I felt lonely with my grief because no one in my family could understand how I was grieving as a mother. And I was anxious that my friends were trying to fix me and get me to socialize or get back to the gym. No one seemed to accept that the person I was before Nick's death--that once unstoppable Robyn-- no longer existed. Val: It sounds so isolating for you. No one in your family is the right person to talk to, and your friends don't seem to understand how to relate anymore, even though they are trying. What in the world did you do? Robyn: I had a gut feeling that a grief counselor might help me. For a referral, I asked a pediatrician I liked for years (who had treated my kids when they were younger.) He gave me the name of an excellent therapist, and fortunately I felt comfortable with her. I opened up and shared everything with her. I was especially concerned about how to cope with my husband and children who weren't grieving in the ways I was. A few weeks later, I asked my husband and kids to join for family therapy. They weren't too thrilled about it, but they cared enough to go for a few sessions. I was relieved this therapy resulted in finding a solution about how I could have Nick's things around me without this upsetting my husband. We decided to put Nick's little things in a box on the counter, so when I wanted to connect with Nick I could just get his things out of the box and then put them away. Believe it or not, this simple solution made a huge difference for me and my husband! Val: Wow. I love what you just said. And what a perfect solution to use the box for Nick's things. Robyn: Eventually my daughter, Olivia, started going into the box, getting out his harmonica and coin collection, and sharing memories about Nick with me. But still...I had a long way to go to get used to my new normal without Nick in my life. Indeed, we all had new normals without Nick in our lives. But one day a thoughtful friend connected me on Facebook with a friend of his named Carole who had recently lost her child to an overdose. Very soon we were talking on the phone. We could \"go there\" with the horrible things that no one else could talk about. For our first face-to-face meeting, Carole met me at the cemetery where both of our kids were buried. Can you believe it--both of our kids were in the same cemetery lying near each other! We sat on the grass and cried together. We made a pact with each other that we would \"take care of our kids\" every day by going to the cemetery every day. We agreed that no one could rob us of our grief and the time we needed to \"take care of our kids.\" Soon another friend connected me to other grieving parents through Facebook. In a few months we found out about an organization called Hand Delivered Hope, a group of concerned citizens affected by the opioid epidemic. This group provided street outreach to people who have been impacted, meeting their basic needs so that recovery was possible. Hand Delivered Hope had organized a benefit event where participants were bringing bags of comfort items. My sister and I attended this event, and to my surprise, I made friends easily with other parents and family members who had lost loved ones or had loved ones still struggling. I didn't feel judged or that I had to censor myself from talking about messy and awful topics related to addiction. They busted through the stigma of addiction as I was accepted and welcomed. They asked about Nick, and how I was coping with my grief. They shared their own stories about broken relationships and how their kids were destitute, misguided, broken, or had died through an overdose. It was a safe place to talk honestly as a group, and I immediately realized how healing it was to have this open, warm environment where I could be a grieving mother--rather than trying to be that unstoppable, super-achiever person I used to be. This experience of feeling so welcome with my grief was a big turning point for me. I had a huge revelation, and it all came down to this: My child was not here anymore, but I could help someone else's child. And I could help someone else who was grieving to feel warmth and acceptance. Braintree needed more support groups, fundraising events, educational events, and resource development. Soon after my revelation, one thing led to another. I met another wonderful friend named Rhonda who was involved with a grief support group at GRASP in Brighton. She told me there was no grief support group on the south shore of Massachusetts. And things started moving from there--it was my calling. I believed I was the one to do this. Val: Thankfully, you found a group where you didn't have to hide your grief, and that inspired you to start your own support groups. What about your older friends? Did they fade away? Or were you able to maintain those friendships alongside the new friends you were making? Robyn: Yes, I have been able to keep most of my old friends. I finally managed to figure out how I can fit my old and new friends in my life. First of all, these two groups of friends are two separate groups. I call my old friends my \"before\" friends (before Nick's death) and my new friends my \"after\" friends. The \"after\" friends definitely \"get me\" more easily and I can talk about the good, the bad and ugly stuff with them. However, I truly love my old friends and I tend to do more fun and lively stuff with them--which is just fine for short periods. I don't want to be a \"downer\" with my \"before\" friends. My \"before\" friends still want to see me laugh and socialize, and I'm able to do that on some occasions. I must admit they can still make me laugh. I am glad to have both groups in my life. But I couldn't live without my \"after\" friends. Val: Robyn, what a creative way to make room for all your friends in your life. That also sounds like a beautiful way to embrace your \"before\" self with your \"after\" self. Robyn: Thank you for saying that. It's all taken a long time. This concludes Part One of my conversation with Robyn. In my next post on the Health Story Collaborative, Robyn will share her healing journey with developing The Sun Will Rise Foundation.

While you're busy being angry about your inability to finish a task for work or dreading calling someone back, while you're regretting the choice you made last month, without even knowing it, you're subconsciously reconstructing yourself, and your 'big' worries are trivialities compared to your body's own constant maintenance of what is vital, what keeps you alive. I'm not going to tell you to find someone to hold your hand even when it's callused or scabbed. You've already been told that, and that doesn't mean it always goes well, or will provide what you need. Instead, I'm going to tell you to learn to respect your own scabs, to find elegance and utility in the way your calluses grip your coffee mug. To not think twice before wearing shorts when there are chain grease stripes, scabs and bruises on your legs. It's far too easy to fear someone else's split-second judgment about your scars or calluses or the shape of your muscles. But, while someone else may shake your hand for five seconds, you wear and carry it always. You are the one who watches your fingers nimbly hop the keys of your keyboard as you type, lift the spoon in your breakfast each morning, and gently comb out your hair each night.

Because of this, when Thomas developed anorexia at age fourteen he was faced with the added challenges of combating stigma, finding treatment, and connecting with male peers undergoing similar experiences. After a hospital stint that restored his physical health, Thomas was declared \"cured,\" but his emotional problems remained unaddressed. He relapsed several years later, and this time struggled primarily with orthorexia. Undeterred by the obstacles facing men with eating disorders, Thomas took his well-being into his own hands. He made it his mission to cultivate the community and comprehensive understanding of holistic wellness that enable someone to truly begin the journey of recovery. Thomas recalls how small his world became when he was in his eating disorder, and how obsessed he became with controlling not just food but everything in his life. He shares the techniques and tools he adopted -- like writing -- that helped him detach from ED thoughts and behaviors. As an eating disorder recovery activist, Thomas decries the insidious gender and age discrimination in eating disorder treatment and awareness models across cultures. Societally imposed appearance standards plague men too, and it is not unusual for them to remain undiagnosed despite showing hallmark symptoms of eating disorders. Thomas's story calls upon us all to recognize that men get eating disorders too, and to help expand treatment options and shift the recovery culture to be more inclusive. Originally from Sydney, Australia, Thomas is a student in Tubingen, Germany, pursuing two degrees: one in Communications majoring in Media Production and the other in International Studies majoring in German.

    "data": "When Natalie was in college, the ramifications of her eating disorder reached their pinnacle when she landed in the cardiac intensive care unit. Her heart was in severe distress due to the toll that restriction and over-exercising had taken on her body. Though previously she had minimized, rationalized, and outright denied having an eating disorder, immediate attention became mandatory. After stabilizing in an inpatient unit, Natalie sought residential care atMonte Nido Vistabecause she has been exposed to Carolyn Costin's views on recovery from the book8 Keys to Recovery from an Eating Disorder. Natalie stayed at Vista from July through September 2014. Transitioning back into life in Chicago proved harder than she anticipated. While Monte Nido believes that everyone can become fully recovered and live a life free of an eating disorder, Natalie's step-down treatment program in Chicago promoted the more limiting model that eating disorder symptoms can only ever be managed, never fully alleviated. Nearly one year later, Natalie considers the tricky relationship between her depression, anxiety, and eating disorder, and admits that although she is sometimes inclined to isolate, it never serves her recovery. She reflects on what is gained by being vulnerable, and how much better she feels when she speaks her truth, without judgment. She knows she needs to be vigilantly honest with the people in her life, and to nurture the relationships that are healthy and to let go of those that aren't. Despite the bumps of recovery, Natalie reminds herself: \"I am capable\" - truly, we all are. Currently 23-years-old, Natalie lives in Chicago and is completing her last semester at college, pursuing a bachelor's in nutrition and dietetics.",

Over the years, she cycled through various behaviors, including compulsively exercising, restricting, binging, and purging. Kristie - like so many of us - was told her disorder was chronic, that \"recovery\" meant maintaining her eating disorder, not overcoming it. But she wasn't willing to settle for this prognosis. So she sought out treatment options in the Northern Hemisphere, found Monte Nido, and embarked upon her path towards recovered. Kristie speaks candidly about the challenges of recovery: there is no clear way it is supposed to look; sometimes it is necessary to follow a meal plan, but the goal is to move towards intuitive eating; she had to acquire basic life skills that the eating disorder prevented her from learning previously; her eating disordered mentality also manifested in finances and relationships; and the differences in motivation tostartrecovery versus tocontinuein recovery. Now two years into committed recovery, Kristie serves as a mentor for those earlier on in the journey through a global eating disorder recovery peer support program calledMentorConnect. She describes the unique recovery team that she had to create herself, as professional eating disorder recovery resources are greatly lacking in the Southern Hemisphere. Kristie expresses her perspectives that hope is the \"first and crucial\" element in recovery, and how important it is to revolt against cultural messages that encourage body-hatred.

    "data": "We need to continuously pressure the powers that be to conduct more research to help find a cure for this devastating illness. So many of us have suffered, been told we are crazy, and been told we are addicts because of our need for pain medicine. We are labeled drug seekers at our hospitals and are denied proper treatment as a result. I fear that if something is not done to raise awareness about gastroparesis, the number of people who perish as a result of this horrible disease will only continue to grow. Hi, I am Regina. I am 50 years old. My story begins January 28, 2008, with a middle of the night trip to the emergency room for uncontrollable abdominal pain and vomiting. Let me first say that prior to this date, I was a pretty healthy woman, working two jobs and traveling a lot for work. On this dreadful night in 2008, I was so sick I had to go to the ER. I had no idea what was going on, but they ran some tests and said my gallbladder was filled with stones and sludge and therefore had to be removed. I arrived at the ER at 4:30 a.m. and was in surgery by 9:00 a.m. I awoke in recovery in severe pain and figured this was normal post-surgery pain. But the pain continued, even after receiving pain medications. By day two, I was vomiting again and could not stop. I could not eat or drink. By day five, they had me somewhat under control and discharged me with paperwork describing a diet to follow after gallbladder removal. The next few months consisted of weekly trips to the ER for pain and vomiting, as well as several more hospitalizations and tests in an effort to figure out why I was still in this condition. By May, I was unable to work consistently and decided to go on short-term disability until they could find a way to cure this problem. Then a gastroenterologist at the local hospital suggested that perhaps I see another gastroenterologist at UPENN or Temple University, as he thought that perhaps I could have gastroparesis as a result of the surgery. I did my research (as I worked in the healthcare field as a Fraud Investigator for a major insurance company), and determined that the best place to go would be Temple, as they had a section of the GI department which was dedicated to gastroparesis. I made an appointment to see the head gastroenterologist there, Dr. Parkman, but before I could get to that appointment, I was hospitalized again locally. Eventually, I was transferred to Temple. They kept me in Temple for almost a month, running every test I had never heard of, and by the end of that hospitalization, they told me I had severe gastroparesis. My Gastric Emptying Study showed 96% retention after four hours. In August of that year, I had surgery for a Gastric Stimulator. The stimulator helped me only a little. I continued to have repeated hospitalizations over the next few years, and my condition only worsened. By Feb 2011, I had gone from a physically active, 165 pound, athletic woman to a 90 pound version of who I used to be. During one hospitalization, they refused to discharge me until I agreed to let them insert a g-tube and a j-tube so that they could put me on tube feedings and keep me from becoming malnourished and losing more weight. I now weigh about 120 pounds, but I continue to suffer from near constant abdominal pain and intractable vomiting. I am still hospitalized multiple times a year and have had several different types of procedures and surgeries, including Botox injections. To this day, I am nowhere close to the normal woman I used to be. She is long gone. I am now a weak, somewhat feeble woman who often needs to use a wheelchair to get around, as I sometimes do not even have the strength to walk around my apartment. They say that there are no more answers for me at this point in time and I just need to accept my condition. I am fifty years old, and I am limited as to what I can do. I am restricted to a full liquid diet, and every time I eat, I end up in the ER within hours or days. I cannot be around sick people at all, or I will get sicker than sick, and inevitably, I end up with an infection ten times worse than what I was exposed to. I have had multiple instances of MRSA and other staph infections that have put me in the hospital, and even nursing homes, for months at a time. We need to continuously pressure the powers that be to conduct more research to help find a cure for this devastating illness. So many of us have suffered, been told we are crazy, and been told we are addicts because of our need for pain medicine. We are labeled drug seekers at our hospitals and are denied proper treatment as a result. I fear that if something is not done to raise awareness about gastroparesis, the number of people who perish as a result of this horrible disease will only continue to grow. Despite the difficulties associated with my gastroparesis, there are several things I have learned about myself and about my life since my diagnosis. I was always a very career oriented person and my job was my life. I loved the travel that came with the job, and after being diagnosed, I did not know how to define myself as a disabled, non-working person. But what I learned over time is that my job did not define me and neither does my illness. I may not be able to help others in the same manner I did while working, but by being a part of the support groups I am in, I am now able to help others in a different way. I believe that my God uses me to help others through my life experience. I can help people who are newly diagnosed by assuring them that gastroparesis is not a death sentence; rather, it is another obstacle that I can overcome and that teaches me I am stronger than what life throws at me. I have made several wonderful friendships with men and women from all over the globe. And though I have never met these people, we help each other tremendously on a daily basis. We band together to try to create awareness and change for the way the medical world handles our illness. There is still so much to learn about gastroparesis, and if I can be even one single voice that is heard in the world of this devastating illness, then I can turn the negative into a positive and perhaps help others who are diagnosed in the future.",

    "data": "Bradley Lewis - psychiatrist, philosopher, and professor - has spent his career in the classroom and clinic attending to stories of health and illness. Two years ago, Brad's lifelong inquiry into the crucial dimension of story in illness experience took an unforeseen turn. He entered the medical system as a patient when his eyesight began to fail, gradually but persistently, which led to a diagnosis of cataracts. As Brad's eyesight worsened, he grappled with the distinction between being viewed by society as able-bodied or as disabled. When he could no longer see the slides in faculty meetings, or see his students as well in the classroom, or read materials as quickly for committee meetings, he better saw how \"unsympathetic the normative world can be\" to the loss of functions we often take for granted. \"It's a big deal to have to navigate that.\" Brad trained in psychiatry in the early 1980's, but felt dissatisfied with the field's heavy emphasis on biology over biography. At the time, psychiatry was transitioning from a psychoanalytic perspective to a biological one. He recalls feeling \"like they both had something valuable to say, but the two messages weren't integrated at all...it left us to put it together as best we could.\" So he started taking classes in the philosophy department to explore the mind/body connection. As he became more involved in the arts, humanities, and cultural studies, he realized that psychiatry was under-emphasizing what really matters to people when they're going through difficult times: story. Brad completed his psychiatric training, which he augmented with a Ph.D. in the humanities. He has written and taught extensively on the intersections between medicine and narrative, and believes stories must be prioritized as a crucial dimension of healthcare. Stories are powerful tools that can aid in healing because \"stories are beyond right or wrong. They're metaphorical.\" Soon after receiving his cataracts diagnosis, Brad opted for surgery. This surprised him, for he tends to challenge the common impulse to adopt a highly medicalized approach. In both academic and clinical settings, Brad encourages individuals to ask: \"What kinds of alternative ways to telling this story might there be? What languages make sense to you?\" He believes \"it's okay if we combine languages - spiritual with biological, for example. There are all kinds of stories that we can bring together to make sense of not only the past, but the future.\" In his own case, the disease model that involved seeking an immediate, surgical solution to the problem felt appropriate to him. However, he still strongly feels that \"if someone doesn't like using disease models and metaphors, that's fine. There are lots of other models and metaphors. And if someone finds disease models and metaphors helpful, that's okay, too.\" For clinicians working with their patients, \"it's about meeting the patient where they are, offering them language and support that best serves the healing they have to do.\" Although he adopted the disease model language and approach in his own case, Brad still felt at odds with his care providers. \"The doctor I finally found really just treated me like a machine. She couldn't relate to me as a person at all, even though I guess she was one of the best.\" Like so many patients, Brad felt apprehensive entering the medical system \"because a lot of people are trying to make a buck out of it. They want to sell you more than you need. And any kind of rating system is hard to make sense of. They are biased towards values that I don't particularly share. I had to do a lot of work to find someone I thought could have a conversation with me.\" And he knows, from his scholarship and clinical practice, how imperative it is for a patient to work with a caregiver who can engage with their situation as a story. Brad has written extensively about narrative medicine, a field that examines how to be sensitive and attentive to stories in healthcare. He sees story as functioning in multiple ways: \"Narrative takes a whole bunch of things that don't seem to fit together - like our body, our illnesses, our dreams, our childhood, religion and spirituality, culture - and allows us to tell stories that bring all those variables together. Story seems to be central in helping people understand themselves in time and to put their life in perspective with a variety of different variables that are influencing them.\" Brad believes that \"the practice of collaboratively telling stories in the clinical setting empowers both people in the room - clinician and patient - to begin to weave those possibilities together in a way that makes sense to them.\" But the stories he brought to the providers he met with about his cataracts were not well received. Near-sighted all of his life, Brad thought he might want to correct for near-vision. When he proposed this idea, it \"befuddled\" his doctor and the team because it meant he would still need to wear glasses. They shut down his request to explore this possible unfolding of his story, which caused him to once again feel outside the norm and isolated. \"So then I had to get support from friends...people who had personal experience and could help me navigate it and keep me company so I wouldn't be all by myself with the clinical team that was so sure of itself.\" Brad strongly recommends others follow suit by seeking support from alternative sources. \"A lot of people who are dealing with the healthcare system need friends with them in the process. Bring comrades who've been through it too.\" Ultimately, the surgery was successful, and Brad accrued insights into the patient experience he hadn't before been able to grasp so intimately. \"Your personal experience matters. You're not just a machine. You have preferences. You have to grieve for different things. You have different values about what you want. Medical decisions are personal decisions, they're not just medical decisions, not something you can read off a medical protocol. Each person has different angles about what they care about and how they want to approach it.\" Bradley Lewis MD, PhD is associate professor at New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study. He has affiliated appointments in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis and the Department of Psychiatry. Brad writes and teaches at the interface of medicine, psychiatry, humanities, and cultural/disability studies. He is an associate editor for theJournal of Medical Humanitiesand his recent books areNarrative Psychiatry: How Stories Shape Clinical PracticeandDepression: Integrating Science, Culture, and Humanities. His current research is devoted to the ways art, politics, and spirituality impact human flowering. I have experienced the powerful effect stories have in healing as both a patient and as a caregiver in the role of a full-spectrum doula, which involves supporting women through abortion, miscarriage, and fetal loss. As a graduate of the Narrative Medicine master's program at Columbia University, my driving mission in life is to elicit, honor, and attend to stories. I am the Assistant Director of theCenter for Narrative Practice, which provides people with deep critical training in how stories work and trains them to apply this knowledge to everyday life by using narrative practice, creative arts, and the study of story. I also curate an oral narrative project called \"Inside Stories: Medical Student Experiences\", for which I interview medical students about their experiences in medical school with the intention to provide a platform for their own person healing, self-realization and empowerment through the sharing and receiving of personal stories. I am honored to serve as Program Officer for Health Story Collaborative. As such, I conduct interviews, edit audio stories, and write a blog posts that profile remarkable individuals committed to honoring and making use of stories in health care. If you or someone you know might be interested in being interviewed, please contact me athealthstorycollaborative@gmail.com.",

Born with congenital scoliosis in 1950, she spent many years in and out of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), confined to her bed for months at a time. Her art is informed by her experience living with a \"deformity\", as it was referred to in those times, as well as by her childhood growing up in the old \"West End\" of Boston, a low-income but culturally rich neighborhood close to MGH and the Charles River which was razed in the late 1950s, displacing many residents, and replaced by residential high rises which still stand today. Evelyn's childhood was marked by sadness--alcoholism in her family, the loss of her nine year old brother when she was six, not to mention her own medical condition--but it was also full of beauty, love and color. Her artwork portrays this complexity and texture. Today, she is a wife, mother to two grown children, an art teacher and therapist as well as an extraordinary storyteller. She weaves her life stories into her art with skill and grace, and she reminds us all that we have the power within us to transform our experiences. \"It's all in you\", she says. \"It's hard to do, and it takes energy, but if you can focus on something that will bring you joy, even in the midst of tremendous sorrow and pain, it can shift everything.\" You can listen to Evelyn talk about more of her paintings, and view the original publication of this piece on WBUR's Commonhealth Bloghere.",

    "data": "Chris is a 38-year-old Ph.D. student who spent 10 years struggling with and fighting against his psychotic illness. His condition has been hard to diagnose -- it's been characterized as Bipolar and Schizoaffective Disorder at various times. Regardless of the specific diagnosis, the bottom line is the same: Chris has a lifelong mental health condition. He hears voices, and has suffered from paranoia, depression and mania along the way. His symptoms started when he was a 25-year-old grad student in New York City. Before that, according to his mother, Eileen, he was extremely high functioning -- an excellent student, an athlete and a friend to many. She would never have suspected that her son would become ill. But when he grew paranoid and started acting erratically, Eileen began to worry. Ultimately, when she realized how sick her son had become, she knew she had to act. She quickly learned how difficult it is to get help for someone who is mentally ill but over the age of 18. Eventually, after multiple frustrating and unsuccessful attempts to get Chris into treatment, she was told \"you need to find three strong men who love him, and you need to go get him, and you need to take him to a hospital,\" and this is what she did. Eileen's story highlights the challenges of navigating the mental health system and of accepting and ultimately embracing her son's medical condition. These days, Chris says he is in a different and better place. He has accepted his illness and has learned to manage it with medications, therapy and his support systems. Like any chronic condition, it requires constant monitoring, but he feels equipped to handle the ups and downs and he has become quite skilled at recognizing his symptoms and titrating his medications in response. He is now a Ph.D. student at the University of New Hampshire's Natural Resources and Earth Systems Sciences program, where he is integrating environmental economics with his background in environmental sciences and engineering. He is engaged to be married and will soon gain a step-daughter. Though his illness complicates his life, he has learned to live with it while maximizing his happiness and productivity. Unfortunately, and despite much talk to the contrary, mental and physical health problems are treated very differently in our society. We marginalize the mentally ill, and often fail to see the individual underneath the diagnosis. In so doing, we make it hard for such individuals to seek help and to move forward. Why this double standard? Why the stigma? For many of us, it is easier and less scary to imagine losing physical capabilities than it is to imagine losing control over our mind, even temporarily. In fear, we distance ourselves and see the mentally ill as \"other\". This distancing is detrimental on an individual and a societal level. Instead, we should listen and try to understand, and focus on our similarities instead of our differences.

    "data": "\"Kate, I just got a call from Jane. She wanted to know whether we wanted to go...wanted to go to...\" My mother closes her eyes and scrunches her brows together as she says this, trying to find the word in her brain. I ask, \"Whether we wanted to go to church with her?\" As my mother then thanks me, I try to hide my unease. Such exchanges - in which my mother forgot a word or an entire idea, and I completed her sentence - began when my mother was only 51 years old and I was a sophomore in high school. By the end of my senior year, my mother's condition had worsened to the point where she could not comprehend my daily notes, which only said when I would return home from school. My mother emotionally changed during this time as well. She often became angry, especially when she attempted to deny her memory issues. Sometimes, though, her denial gave way to sadness, as she accepted her new truth: she had the memory struggles of a much older woman. Both of these emotions - anger and sadness - underline how difficult my mother's memory problems were and still are, for her and for my whole family. We all struggle. We watched her undergo a staggering change - from an exceedingly intelligent woman who graduated magna cum laude from college to one struggling to read. Despite these clear symptoms, help was difficult to find. At first, my mother attempted to empower herself and take action. She reached out to a local health case management organization that accepted her state insurance. This facility provided her with samples of trial medication to hinder the progression of her memory loss. Struggling just to pay rent, we could have never afforded these medications on our own. My mother regularly took her medication. She did crossword puzzles. She felt hope - until the organization's medication samples ran out. She came home from her appointment that day and declared that she would never go back. Ultimately, my mother would need to visit a geriatric health center specializing in care for the elderly in order to get a formal memory examination and brain imaging. With state insurance, we waited for months to get an appointment. It took a full three years to get a diagnosis, though we were grateful to have the costs covered. In the end, my mother was diagnosed with Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), an illness I had never heard of before. This disease has no clear causes or risk factors, except for possible genetic inheritance, and no known treatments. It causes shrinkage in the frontal and temporal areas of the brain, often at a young age (between 40 and 70 years old), resulting in emotional liability as well as memory problems. As in my mother's case, it is often initially misdiagnosed as mental illness. This is not necessarily the physicians' fault, however; FTD and certain psychiatric disorders manifest themselves in remarkably similar ways. This is a small reminder of how health challenges connect us all. Once my family and I learned that my mother's true illness was FTD, we were overwhelmed. We were shocked by the devastating emotional changes that would come with FTD. We also had to learn how to navigate the modern health and legal systems. As my mother became increasingly dependent, and we focused on issues such as paying her bills and finding her a safe place to live, we had to simultaneously \"prove\" her disability in court. Now, my father has acquired the title \"Conservator of Person\" so that he, with input from me and my siblings, can make decisions on my mother's behalf. This isn't easy. My mother does not recognize that she has memory issues. Without realizing it, she often acts like a child. She cannot participate in society, or even in our family community, like she used to; she cannot read the newspaper or even a simple word, and she lacks the emotional stability to maintain relationships. She craves attention from others, though, and will even have temper tantrums when she feels ignored. I have watched my mother stomp off to her room, sulking, many times. One of these temper tantrums actually caused her first adult daycare center to dismiss her. The employees at the center felt that my mother agitated other clients against the caregivers. Perhaps she did, unintentionally; my mother does quickly become anxious and upset when she is not actively engaged in an activity or when her day deviates from routine. She dislikes boredom and harbors a longing to be helpful - an impulse which often goes unrecognized by society. My mother is actually quite eager to perform simple tasks, like setting a table. She loves to feel usefully engaged and be an active participant in chores or activities. I am grateful that my mother can actively participate in this way at her current daycare center. Here, she feels safe and full of purpose. My mother loves to attempt to help other clients. She often talks with them when they feel sad or upset, and this truly helps other clients to manage their emotions. My mother also participates in art therapy, pet therapy, and simple sport games, along with other clients. She really enjoys the social, recreational atmosphere that the center offers her. At this center, my mother's caregivers provided her with a community and a purpose. They support her and treat her with compassion. To them, my mother is an adult woman - which seems to be a simple thought yet is actually a profound affirmation of a dementia patient, who is often stereotyped for immature behavior and simplicity. Dementia patients are adults, although they might act like children, and they deserve to be treated as such. Surrounded by such positive treatment and respectful attitudes at her daycare center, my mother has been happy in the past few years. But with the passage of time, she now needs more intensive care. She struggles more, internally and externally. Her emotions have become quite explosive and unpredictable. Daily activities, such as bathing or brushing her teeth, have become lengthy and complicated exertions. My mother's daily hygiene routine is a particularly potent source of frustration and stress for her, and this exemplifies how her internal and external conflicts are quite connected. Dementia has affected my mother's physical abilities and personality, as well as her memory. With dementia, and perhaps with illness in general, the physical and the internal are often intimately connected. This connection between the physical and the emotional can make care-giving a complicated endeavor. My father is currently struggling to completely care for my mother, when she is not in adult daycare. My mother definitely needs full-time health services, but they are difficult to secure. Because of the high demand for a spot in a specialty care facility, immediate placement is rare unless it occurs in in the aftermath of a hospitalization. My mother has been on wait-lists at multiple long-term care facilities for more than two and a half years. For now, I am incredibly grateful that my father and her adult daycare center are able to meet most of her changing needs and desires. My family's experience with FTD has changed me. Now, I am committed to advocating for greater health resources for all, especially the most marginalized. While my mother's illness is rare, I hope that my family's story encourages others to work for broader change. I hope others contact legislators about extending health care access for patients and caregivers. More generally, I hope my mother's story can also increase awareness that different kinds of dementia exist. Some dementia patients, such as my mother, can remain quite active participants in particular communities. Though individuals struggling with dementia have gone through much personal loss, they may retain their desire to be involved and help others. They can help others, and have much more to offer than one may initially think - if their community will accept them. As a student in college, I imagine the possibility of experiencing dementia myself in the future. I know what it is like to worry about the shortness of life in the face of medical difficulties. In this way, I feel I am connected to many others - to other students and to other individuals in general - who experience and observe a myriad of health challenges every day. Despite the fragility of health, we can be conscious of all that we have and try our best to always value and make the most of our time.

    "data": "Segment 2 of 6 in ourSoul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill series. By Shaler Wright Introduction I'd like to thank Health Story Collaborative for working with me to bring you \"Soul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill.\" This monthly audio series offers a soulful perspective on how to navigate the unique challenges of living with ongoing health conditions. My name is Shaler McClure Wright and I live with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. Story We're hip-deep in holiday season as I make this recording. Daylight is giving way to darkness, while we're wading through a sea of festivity. Holidays can be tough for those of us with chronic illness. Rushing around, overextending ourselves can cause flare-ups in our symptoms. That's no way to celebrate! So how can we protect ourselves, yet still participate? We need to build a holiday toolkit. Let's begin with an empty box and see what happens. We know that nature abhors a vacuum, so if at first we do nothing, what do you think will fill it? American poet Mary Oliver envisioned her answer in this short poem that came to her in her sleep: \"Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this, too, was a gift.\" (Mary Oliver,The Uses of Sorrow) The gift of darkness takes time to understand because it takes us a while to get past our simplistic, fearful conception of the dark. Once we put that aside, we can see that the gift of darkness is also an invitation--to slow down and feel more deeply. Yes, darkness is an invitation to spend time with soul. By soul I mean the part of us that embraces ancient wisdom and acknowledges the value of intuition. Connecting with soul takes us outside of ourselves and opens us to the spiritual and natural worlds. For me, walking in the forest is a soulful activity. I wonder what feels soulful to you? The energy of darkness is soulful. Mystical, magical, creative energy. Ann Ulanoff, author and Jungian analyst, writes about the healing power of the imagination. She explains darkness like this: \"Darkness... characterizes the world of the unseen, and the mysterious processes of the unconscious where creative activity starts.\" (Ann Ulanov, The Feminine in Jungian Psychology and in Christian Theology, 1971, pp. 170-71). Darkness offers a fertile space for exploring possibilities for our actions and reactions. Darkness is a great incubator. And darkness is restorative, as it facilitates healing through stillness and rest. Without it, our physical resilience suffers. So why do we go to extremes to resist the soulful invitation of darkness? It's too different from the energy of everyday life. The soulful energy of darkness emerges from a place of quiet contemplation, and this goes against our carefully cultivated habits of busyness and productivity. So we resist, even though we need to replenish the energy we've spent throughout the year. Think about it, the most festive holidays fall in the darkest time of year. We cling to an extended cycle of celebration in defiance of natural order. We can feel nature pull us toward quiet, but we ignore her. Even at our own peril. Mother Nature wants us to slow down, like the animals do, but instead, we crank up the volume of daily life and try our hardest to keep busy. In America, we cling to mega-sized holiday traditions. But excess doesn't feed our soul. Simplicity does. Perhaps we can learn a lesson from the Littlest Angel.The Littlest Angelis a children's story written in 1946 by Charles Tazewell. It follows heaven's youngest--and clumsiest--angel, who was allowed to keep one thing from his childhood on Earth to help him adjust. He chose a small, dingy box holding 'a butterfly with golden wings, a sky-blue egg from a robin's nest, two white stones from a muddy river bank, and a tooth-marked leather strap, once worn as a collar by his mongrel dog.\" Objects that elicit memories. Objects that serve as symbols of the life he loved. Without knowing it, the Littlest Angel had assembled a box that would give him the resilience he needed to adapt to life after death. Wouldn't you like to assemble a box like that? A box of resilience? Right now our holiday toolkit is filled with darkness, soul and energy. But what if that's not enough? What else might we add to give us the resilience we need? Perhaps if we choose as carefully as the Littlest Angel chose, we will find out. Perhaps we can transform our box of darkness into a box of resilience by adding symbols of strength from our life. Let's imagine what those might be... * A joyful memory can give us strength. I'll add the blue booties my child was wearing when he took his first steps. How about you? * An unexpected act of kindness can give us strength. I'll add the four leaf clover my mother found for me when I was feeling very, very unlucky. * A personal ritual can give us strength. I'll add the matches I use to light a candle when I meditate. * And finally, a free pass (to do less) can give us strength (to do what's important). I'll give myself permission to upack five bins of holiday decorations instead of nine. Still not sure? Let's imagine a simple scenario of how we might use the new tools in our box... It's Christmas Eve morning. We begin our day by quietly filling the bird feeder outside our kitchen window, as we do every day. But today there are three red cardinals perched in the closest evergreen. We're reminded of how our grandfather taught us to always look for their mates, who might feel forgotten because they blend in with the brown bark of a tree. Holding the image of redness, we smile and remember the thick red wool socks our grandfather always wore for the holidays. Then we receive a notification from UPS that our most important gift for our child is lost in transit. We panic and beat ourselves up for not having ordered it sooner. We get a headache and start to feel shaky and fear our symptoms will cascade. But instead of escalating our pain by quickly trying to do something to fix things, we give ourselves permission to pause and do nothing. In that moment of stillness, we imagine a creative solution to our problem. And we write a letter to our child, describing every detail of the missing gift and explaining why we chose it, and what we hope it will mean to them. We place the letter in a colorful envelope and tie it with a red bow, smiling once again at our memory of red socks. The doorbell rings. It's the UPS man. He has come to work early to search their pile of damaged packages and he's found ours. The gift is unharmed. We feel surprised, relieved and blessed. While wrapping our child's gift we realize the letter we wrote to take its place is perhaps more important than the gift itself. And by choosing to do less--by choosing not to run out and buy something else--we have actually given ourselves the opportunity to do more. We have accepted the invitation of darkness and soul, and given expression to a meaningful gift from our heart. Things have a way of working out. And even with all the cultural pressure to do more, it's still our personal privilege to choose to do less. To stay healthy. To seek deeper, quieter solutions to our problems. Soulful solutions that enrich us instead of draining our energy. So, whether we celebrate Diwali, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Solstice or Christmas, we each deserve a holiday toolkit that can help us make better use of mother nature's restorative gift of darkness. Because resilience is born in the dark.

    "data": "By Katy Morley I closed my eyes, slumped against the wall in the dim light of Universal Music's Santa Monica studio A. A familiar fatigue had oozed through me--sludging up my thoughts, burning my eyes, leadening my head--until I surrendered to the wooden floor. I inhaled deeply, following the cool, climate-controlled air into my lungs, and heard the music clarify, like a tuned radio. Pouring from the speakers was the recording we'd just made of my song, \"Sleeping in My Own Bed\" and I felt of a surge of joy. Scattered around the control room were the engineer, producer, drummer, bassist, pianist, and my manager. We were deciding our favorite take before recording the next song. \"Yeah!\" Stray, my producer, said with avid Aussie intonation, \"that's the one, no?\" I coaxed my eyes open to look at him, grateful I could trust his ears when mine had become fuzzy. \"Definitely.\" I smiled back, hoping I had conveyed convincing enthusiasm. Because it was real. Today was one of the most joyous and meaningful days I'd had in my 29 years on earth--I was fulfilling my decade-long dream of recording an album. An album of songs that came from depths I didn't know I had access to, with phenomenal musicians who loved and elevated the music. I was even singing into a hallowed microphone Frank Sinatra once used. But despite this elation, I could not overcome my body's imperative to crumple and my mind succumbing to fog. 11 | BEFORE We called it Polar Dog Day. June 6th was the official day when all three members of our nascent religion must enter the frigid, freshly melted waters of our hometown's namesake, White Bear Lake. My fellow pagans were neighborhood twins whom I'd convinced, to their Lutheran parent's chagrin, to form our nature-worshiping church. Aside from an annual icy baptism, devotional practice mostly consisted of hanging out and doing homework in trees. I spent long contented hours perched on the limb of a holy Ash, reading and thinking, shrouded by a cloak of green, then amber and crimson, then remembered leaves. 19 | BEFORE Alone in my university's painting studio, I turned up the radio and walked back to my easel, singing along to the upstate New York golden oldies station.Once upon a time you dressed so fine, threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?Bob Dylan, a fellow Minnesotan, whose music would radically alter my vision of myself, eventually inspiring me to abandon academia to sing and write songs. It was past midnight on a Friday and I could hear the drunken shouts and laughter of students on their way to parties and bars. I would join them dancing later, but I didn't drink. I abstained initially as a response to my father going to rehab at an age when my peers were just starting to sneak alcohol, but had since learned to relish lucidity. My few experiences drinking had taught me I was particularly sensitive to hangovers; I lamented how they left me physically drained and mentally muddled, swallowing precious days of my life. It was both an awareness of my mortality, but also a profound enthrallment with the mystery of human consciousness that made me feel wasteful dulling it down. Since coming to college I'd voraciously studied consciousness, taking neuroscience and existentialism classes, biology, acting, and Buddhism classes, devouring all angles into the enigmatic phenomenon, elated by my brain's growing power to cross-pollinate different fields of knowledge, to discover and articulate new ideas. Tonight though, buzzing from a victorious game with my intramural hockey team, Natty Ice, I enjoyed a less cerebral experience of consciousness, blissfully smearing colors onto a canvas. 21 | ONSET Plastered to my sweaty sheets I willed myself to hobble to the bathroom to pee. I reached to flush and noticed the porcelain bowl full of dark brown liquid. I looked in the mirror and saw my neck swollen like a linebacker's. My natural response was to push through illness-growing up I would pretend not to be sick so I wouldn't have to miss school and fall behind in class-but my then boyfriend convinced me to see the school physician. Strep throat and mononucleosis. I called my parents to say I wouldn't make it home for Thanksgiving. \"Do you think you should take the semester off?\" my mother asked. \"I don't know,\" I said, \"there are only a few weeks left.\" I had worked tirelessly through demanding senior year courses to maintain a near perfect GPA and I dreaded retaking them all. The same anxiety about falling behind when I was sick as a girl, about keeping impeccable grades, gripped me. When classes resumed after Thanksgiving break, I shakily dressed myself and trudged to the art building. I was late. As Professor Knecht lectured, I leaned against the wall in the back, heaving breaths and feeling I might pass out. After class I asked my professor if I could have an extension on our midyear project. I explained my illness, that I was just so exhausted. \"You're not that sick,\" he said. His wife was currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer and he had no patience for my fluffy sleepy disease. I heard for the first time, a refrain I'd hear throughout the next decade: \"everyone's tired.\" 22 - 24 | AFTER Year one. A year after I was expected to recover from mono, Dr. Anderson met my concern of persistent exhaustion with, \"kids your age don't sleep enough.\" I felt dismissed, but was too uncertain in myself to push back. If she didn't take it seriously, I thought it must not be an issue and would go away. Year two. Dr. Anderson referred me to a sleep clinic where I filled out a questionnaire and was diagnosed with insomnia. I learned about sleep hygiene, that I should never nap, and that 'sleepy' meant 'prone to falling asleep,' that I was technically 'fatigued.' I knew insomnia wasn't the issue. My poor sleep was intermittent, and the exhaustion persisted even when I consistently slept 8-10 hours a night. But at 23 years old, and feeling less and less like myself, I didn't know how to contest the certainty of the medical authority I'd trusted since childhood. Year three. \"You say it's been years?\" Dr. Anderson asked, and agreed to run some blood tests. Everything checked out fine except for low vitamin D levels, a common issue for Minnesotans. But most startling to me, was a short line in her report that I only read years later, sleuthing through the medical records I'd requested she send to my new doctor when I moved to California: \"Patient does not appear tired.\" Patient does not appear tired. My doctor, who had worked with me from the age of 16, who was my mother's doctor, who knew me as the girl who played reverse hooky, had decided to note that my subjective account of crippling fatigue was contradicted by my objective appearance. I was in her eyes-and the eyes of many doctors to come-a girl who saw phantom ailments. And I was slowly joining that world of ghosts. 28 | AFTER I clutched the steering wheel, terrified sobs mounting into rhythmic hyperventilation. First big tour. First panic attack. I had only played two shows of my three-week run supporting the British singer, Lapsley, and in my weakened state I found the physical toll unbearable: waking up early, packing the car with heavy musical instruments and electronic gear, driving to a new city, finding food that didn't make me sick, unpacking gear into the venue, assembling and soundchecking a complex stage set up under tight time pressure, performing through painful exhaustion, disassembling the stage set up, repacking the car, finding food that didn't make me sick, driving to the hotel, unpacking the car, crashing late into bed, wired and nervous before waking up early and doing it all again. On stage, I was near collapse and so murky I couldn't trust myself to play the right notes. I'd devoted my life to music because singing made me feel the most alive and most myself. It was the feeling of telling the truth, that I couldn't be questioned. But at these shows I felt like a fraud. I was fumbling through the motions on the fumes of sheer anxious energy, and alone, in the car, the relentless strain overtook me. 26 - 29 | AFTER The following is a list of specialty diagnoses and treatments I received throughout my late 20's: Stomach ulcers - omeprazole. Asthma - a steroid inhaler, which corroded my throat and interfered with my ability to sing. Leaky gut syndrome - no gluten, dairy, refined grains or sugar. Allergies - no more morning walks through pollen-filled Temescal Canyon. Chronic fatigue - endless supplements and tinctures. Unbalanced energy - $400 tea brewed by a Chinese herbalist. Most of all, depression - \"have you considered antidepressants?\" 30 | AFTER Mother visits. Something is wrong. Staying with me for a few days in Los Angeles, my mom was shocked by my limited life. I slept for 10 - 12 hours a night and needed to lie down again by early afternoon. My diet was so restricted I could eat few meals outside of my kitchen. I felt a constant burning in my stomach, joints, and eyes. I'd stopped running and playing hockey as I'd be bedbound for days after. I'd hit so many medical dead-ends and was so drained I had mostly given up, but she, with the determination of a parent with an ailing child, got to work. Lyme disease. A diagnosis. The relief of a label, a common language to dissolve the isolation of being belittled and misunderstood. But most of all, the relief of being able to trust myself again. How can someone regrow their energy, their very life force, when they're taught they can't be trusted? The doubt I'd internalized after years of dismissal by the healthcare establishment had me waging a war against my own deteriorating body. A diagnosis meant permission to rest, to take my illness seriously. I had just released the first single of the album I was recording, but I decided to put everything on hold. \"Give it a year,\" said Dr. Sugden, my new Lyme specialist, with hope. 31 - 32 | AFTER Eight months taking heaving antibiotics, with no improvement and worsening stomach pain, I stopped. I was put on other aggressive medications, including Malarone, a drug for malaria. Every few months my mother flew out to California and drove us 7 hours to the Bay Area specialty Lyme clinic, exchanging thousands of dollars for me to be believed and try experimental protocols. At one point I was sent a bag of syringes and vials of taurine and magnesium chloride with instructions to inject myself in the stomach twice a day. When I asked how, I was referred to a youtube tutorial about self-administered shots. I left California and had back to back arthroscopic hip surgeries in Minnesota, recovering at my mother's house. Dr. Foley, who ran a nearby integrative medicine practice, prescribed me disulfiram, which new anecdotal evidence was suggesting could benefit chronic Lyme patients. The pharmacist explained that I could not drink alcohol while taking it or I would become severely ill. \"You can't even use hand sanitizer, it will absorb it through your skin.\" I thought, \"when do I ever use hand sanitizer?\" It was February 2020. 33 | AFTER Alina. My angel of reason. My Eastern European functional medicine doctor and nutritionist, recommended by a friend's stepmother. She explained the caustic impact of summoning anxious energy when my natural energy waned: \"You cannot recover if you're in a state of constant stress. It is corrosive to your body, and the fight or flight response overruns other functions, including healing and repair.\" She said the tests confirmed I had Lyme disease and coinfections, but that Epstein Barr virus, the cause of my collegiate mononucleosis, appeared exceedingly active. She explained my low T cell count, my low protein markers, and her theory that my compromised stomach lining was disrupting my body's protein absorption. \"You are young and healthy, we need to figure out why your body isn't healing itself.\" I had tried extreme medications and was ready for a gentler approach. I'd regained enough trust in myself to intuit that's how I needed to heal. I recommitted to the Buddhist meditation classes I'd taken in my early 20's explorations of consciousness. They helped calm my nervous system and gradually recover some of the alert lucidity I'd once taken for granted. Before. A year after COVID-19 ravaged the world, healthcare workers and their patients experienced post-viral fatigue en masse, motivating new research and pushing the previously disparaged condition into prominent cultural conversations; The CDC finally acknowledged Post Treatment Lyme Disease; And I released my album. 35 | NOW My skin prickles as I lower into the chilled water of Hampstead Heath's ladies pond. My body protests against the cold but I push off. I know that after a few strokes my muscles and joints, sore from my recent tour, will welcome the swim. When I moved to London, I chose a place near the Heath because I craved its forests, but had since discovered a love of its swimming ponds. Enticed in by the supposed immune benefits of cold water exposure, I soon remembered the aliveness I felt in the freezing lake dips of my youth. As I glide through the dark water, I am weary but sturdy. I designed my tour so it would allow me to do what I love most: sing. I stripped back my complex band setup to perform simply with a pianist. The nakedness of such a minimal arrangement, with no other instruments to hide behind, put my voice and songs through a trial by fire; I found they were enough. Stripping back also meant traveling light. Rather than driving a car full of equipment, we rode trains with a backpack and keyboard. I had come home from playing shows tired, but I had also tapped a deeper well of energy. The potent energy of purpose, of living, of sharing my heartbreaks and joys in an alchemical act with others who've felt and feel the same. I'd returned, too, with newfound strength-not physical, I knew if I swam too fast or more than two laps I'd still be depleted-but that unshakeable, unquestionable strength of telling the truth. I pass a duck settled on an algae-covered buoy. I am calm and slow, hardly disturbing the water, and she stares back, unruffled. At the next, unoccupied buoy, I stop to rest. I think of my former life skating sprints around ice rinks, of running for uninterrupted miles, and feel a familiar pang of grief, but it is overcome by a greater gratitude for where I am: floating, post-tour, shrouded by a thick canopy of leaves. Later, I meet a friend for a stroll through the woods. We pass an old tree with branches enticingly just out of reach. Taking the challenge, we ascend. How many evenings had I collapsed early into bed, exhausted and aching, mourning a life unlived? But tonight, nestled on the limb of a holy Oak, watching the light fade from London's late summer sunset, I am still awake.

    "data": "Segment III - Ditching the Wig: Completing Treatment & Coping with Late Effects by Rachel Trachten 1. Peach Fuzz My love-hate relationship with the wig is mostly the latter. I hate being bald, I hate having cancer, and I hate needing a wig to look even remotely like my former self. But the wig does serve its purpose. It's top of the line, handmade with natural hair. It makes me look more-or-less like a regular person, albeit a fragile, skinny one. But the wig is heavy and makes my head itch and sweat. I constantly worry that it will get pulled off or slip sideways, revealing my weird alien-like head. In a recurring nightmare, a gust of wind carries all that hair off my head and into the ocean. When a friend suggests trimming the wig, I take her up on the offer. She cuts off a good four inches, and I feel a rare bit of freedom. I take a certain pleasure in watching all that hair fall to the floor as she snips. It's January 1980 and almost time for my very last treatment. The final insult is one more dose of Cytoxan, the nastiest drug of all. It's so toxic that I'll spend the whole day at the hospital getting IV fluids to wash the poisons out. At home, one of my parents will awaken me every hour and convince me to drink eight ounces of water to prevent bladder or kidney damage. By this time, Zach and I are living in a basement rental on Bank Street in the West Village. He's taking some time away from Amherst for an internship in City Council President Carol Bellamy's office. I'm back at NYU while finishing the chemo. We've been living together for several months, and he's encouraging me to come back to our apartment after getting the Cytoxan. \"I want to take care of you,\" he says. \"I'll wake you every hour all night long.\" But I'm not ready for him to see me throwing up. Over his protests, I go home to Brooklyn with my parents. After that last dose of Cytoxan I'm officially finished with treatment. I experiment with thinking of myself as someone who no longer has cancer, but I'm still bald. I try head scarves and turbans but can't come up with a better option than the wig. Gradually, the cold winter days give way to spring. Grass and flowers pop up on the Manhattan streets, and my head sprouts a thin layer of peach fuzz. Zach says it looks adorable. In our West Village neighborhood, it's pretty much the norm to look different. Hair might be dyed pink or blue or gelled into spikes. Black leather and tie-dye are both in fashion, and torn fishnet tights are all the rage, especially with Doc Martens. It's a May afternoon, and I'm getting ready to leave our apartment for a class at NYU. The weather is unusually warm, and I can already feel sweat gathering where the wig presses against my neck. Just as I'm about to head out, I yank it off my head and toss it onto the sofa. I quickly lock the door behind me, trying not to think about what I've just done. With hair that looks more or less like a crew cut, I hit the streets. I'm awkward and self-conscious but love feeling the gentle breeze on my head. I study the faces of people I pass to see if they're staring. No one looks twice as I stroll over to the campus. In my art history class, an acquaintance greets me, and I sit down next to her. \"Nice look,\" she says. \"Who cuts your hair?\" 2. The Party To celebrate the end of treatment, my mom wants to throw a party, but my dad resists. He admits that it scares him, that it feels like hubris: don't flaunt your good fortune or it will be taken away. But in the end, he changes his mind. As an unstated compromise, we decide to call the celebration a \"Good Health\" party as opposed to something that would bring the heavens down on me, like \"Goodbye Cancer,\" or \"Hurray, I'm Cured!\" One way or another, the party planning begins. My longtime friend Jeffrey, who goes on to become a successful chef, offers to do the catering. I was 18 when I started treatment; I'm 20 when it ends. Soon I'll be headed back to Amherst once again. Normal life will resume, won't it? The party is in our Brooklyn backyard on a warm summer evening. Several months have passed since my final treatment, and my hair now approximates the Twiggy look. I've also managed to gain a few pounds, so I'm no longer a literal 98-pound weakling. I feel festive in a light-blue Marimekko sundress with tiny pink and green swirls. That night, we celebrate my good fortune, my survival. People from all corners of my life show up with good wishes, gifts, and champagne. I watch Zach as he chats easily with my relatives and childhood friends. No gods strike me down as I mingle with guests and munch hors d'oeuvres. A chance of rain is in the forecast, but not a drop falls. Still Breathing: Forty years later ... Sometimes people ask about the \"gifts\" of cancer or what I might have gained from the experience. I bristle at the question, though I can't deny that illness has made me a more empathic person. And now that I'm well into middle age and my friends have their own medical problems, I'm often able to commiserate in a deep way. Unlike the experience of being surrounded by immortal teens, having peers in their 50s, 60s, and older means that many of us are grappling with health issues. Being healthy is no longer an absolute goal--it's more a question of figuring out how to cope with whatever disease or disability comes our way. Although I do bring some wisdom to this struggle, the words \"cancer\" and \"gift\" don't belong together in my world. It's a gift I would have been thrilled to return. That said, I've enjoyed many gifts over the years. Zach and I graduated from Amherst and were married two years later. We both wanted children, but my doctors advised against trying to conceive. Undaunted, we adopted a daughter and then a son. We moved across the country to California in 1998, when Julia and Alex were 10 and 5. I joined a local tennis team and imagined playing year-round for decades to come. Maybe the kids would even take up tennis and we could play family doubles. Around the time of my final treatment, Doctor Murphy and other experts warned me that some patients start to experience cardiac problems and other \"late effects\" about 15 years after chemo and radiation. I vaguely took in this doom and gloom, but it all seemed so far away. At the time I thought, \"maybe none of that will happen to me.\" But two years after the move, I started to feel the cardiac symptoms doctors had predicted. I found myself quickly out of breath while taking a jog or running for a forehand. My athletic singles game became a gentle doubles game instead. By the time Alex was a young teen, I'd put my racket away for good. I recall a day we were walking up a steep San Francisco hill together. I had to stop and rest about every five steps. Alex was way ahead but circled back every now and then. \"Aah, you're so slow,\" he teased. Then, \"Will your heart ever get better?\" It was the first time he'd asked such a direct question about my health. I wavered, but decided he was old enough for the truth. \"I don't think so,\" I said, \"unless someone discovers a great new drug.\" He looked down and jammed his sneaker into the sidewalk. \"That sucks.\" \"I know hon, it does.\" At the time I was treated, there was no way to know that the doses of radiation and chemo I was given were likely more than was needed to cure my cancer. That particular protocol was used for a relatively short time before doctors discovered that they could treat Hodgkin's Disease successfullywithoutcausing quite so much long-term damage. My future was determined by a particular moment in medical history: Had I been diagnosed a year or two earlier, the treatment wouldn't have been available and I would likely have died a teenager; if I'd been diagnosed a few years later, I might still be running around a tennis court today. Somewhere between those extremes, life goes on. Julia lives in New York now, and on a recent visit home, she suggests going to an Oakland A's game. Zach (who isn't much of a baseball fan) offers to have dinner waiting when we get home. Julia and I share a love of sports, and the game will be extra special because her beloved Yankees are in town. Unfortunately, a heat wave arrives with the Yankees, and we get to the stadium under a blistering afternoon sun. \"I'll drop you off, Mom,\" Julia says, just as I'm about to make that request. \"Go through the disabled entrance,\" she adds, \"so you don't have to stand outside in this heat.\" It's easily 90 degrees and I'm taking baby steps. The air feels thick and heavy. On a good day I can walk for about 30 minutes, but hills, stairs, and heat have all become powerful obstacles. I follow Julia's advice about the disabled entrance, something I rarely take advantage of. I can often hide my disability by avoiding situations where it might show, though that's becoming harder to do. Julia parks the car and catches up with me inside the stadium. I'm relieved that our seats are in the shade and require minimal stair climbing. It feels great to sit down, and Julia quickly waves at a ballpark vendor selling iced lemonade. I'm breathing easily now, sipping my drink and starting to relax and cool down. I feel a wave of happiness as I take it all in--the noisy crowd, the players jogging onto the field, the sour-sweet lemonade, my daughter beside me.

    "data": "By Anne Betschart I was born in October 1961, joining my two sisters Kathy and Susan. The only unusual event of my birth was that a few hours after my arrival, my cousin Teddy was born in the same maternity ward. My parents had just purchased a new home in the town of Natick. We were the American dream. Happily married couple, children, home in the suburbs...success! In the months that followed, Mom and Dad noticed I wasn't hitting the normal milestones of infancy. Sitting, rolling, and crawling were proving to be very difficult for me. After evaluation and testing, I was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. My case appeared to be hemiplegia, affecting only my left side. As an adult, I would explain my disability as follows: Cerebral Palsy is an injury, not a disease. It is caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain, often during your own birth. Like a stroke, the amount of damage varies. Since my diagnosis came well into my first year, the cause remains unknown. My case is reasonably mild--a weak left side with poor motor skills. Cognition, speech, and right-sided motor skills are considered normal. As a girl, the outward signs of my disability were a significant limp and a left foot that turned inward. I wore an uncomfortable brace in an attempt to correct it. Even as a child, this shoe-obsessed girl recognized the cruelty of not having cute shoes! Every evening, Dad would help stretch out my spastic leg and foot muscles. It was a practice I both loved and hated. Loved because I had private time with Dad, hated because he had to work hard to get those stiff muscles to loosen up. So, there we were. Dad sitting in his comfy chair, smoking a Viceroy cigarette, me sitting on the floor with my leg extended, getting the 1960s version of home physical therapy. Dad was my hero. A pillar of strength who was so devoted to his wife and children. The best version of a girl dad that ever existed! During this time, my parents welcomed 4 more daughters to our family. 18 months after my birth, Kristin was born. A year after that, twins Maureen and Jean. A few years later, Colleen rounded out our house of little women. The twins were born with Down Syndrome and in very poor health. They had severe cardiac issues and were too ill to live at home. We lost Jean at age 1. Maureen passed away at age 4. My parents had to experience crushing grief while also raising five daughters, one with a significant disability. I was too young to understand, but it must have felt unbearable for them We resume life as a family of 7. Daily, my sisters and I would get up, eat breakfast, and join our friends and neighbors on the walk to Brown School. I enjoyed school until the name-calling started in first grade, beginning with \"Peg Leg\" and later turning to \"Gimp,\" muttered to me as kids passed me in the hallways. I pretended I didn't hear. Day after day, year after year, these painful comments eroded my self-esteem and confidence. I tried to talk with my parents about it, but they would tell me that I was fine and could be just like everyone else. \"Just ignore it\" was their advice. My concerns were unheard, so I stopped trying to express them. My insecurities grew and festered and are still part of my personality today. My parents had the best of intentions. They always included me, but things had to be modified. I remember a cold winter day when we went to Uncle Paul's home on the lake. The whole family bundled up for a day of skating. I was told that I could join everyone on the ice, but skates would not be allowed. \"Put your boots on and watch.\" I felt so left out. My sisters looked so free and beautiful, gliding around the ice. It triggered a thought that I carry to this day. I will never be graceful. Things will never feel carefree and easy. It crushed me. In 5th grade, students could select an instrument with hopes of joining the concert band. I was excited. Big sister Kathy could sing, and Susan excelled on her flute. What would my talent be? My parents had the difficult task of telling me that my options were few because of the limited use of my left hand. Dad had a great idea. As a child, he was stricken with polio. After a lengthy hospital stay, he needed to improve his lung strength. He used a trumpet to achieve that goal. He kept the instrument and realized it would be a successful option for me. My left arm was strong enough to hold the trumpet and the fingers on my stronger right side could easily press the three valves. So, I took my hand-me-down trumpet and had enough lessons to become a band member. Eager 5th-grade musicians joining our 6th-grade peers was a thrill. I saw all the girls sitting together with their shiny new flutes and clarinets. I was tucked into the 2nd row of trumpets, the only girl with boys sitting in front of, beside and behind me. The same boys who teased me in the classroom now had their victim surrounded on all sides. I wanted to quit, but we had a rule in our house. We had to honor our commitments. So, I played in the band for the remainder of the year, but stopped after that, never playing an instrument again. A few years later I was not able to take the required typing class. Lack of fine motor skills prevented it. My frustration with school continued. In high school, I realized a clever trick. I would use my disability to convince my gym teacher that physical education was hard. I was rewarded with a free period! Yes, I manipulated, but it saved me the embarrassment of everyone seeing the clumsy uncoordinated girl who would never be good at sports. Mom and Dad recognized that I was emotionally lost. They told me that they felt like a smaller school might give me a fresh start. Entering my junior year, I relocated to a small catholic school one town over. I made a few friends. They would pick me up and we would loaf around with little purpose or motivation. We would disregard curfew, sneak cigarettes and booze. This circle of friends provided something I desperately craved. Acceptance. I didn't have to compete with my smart, graceful talented sisters. I didn't have to be an onlooker of the cool kids in school who dismissed me as Gimp. Fortunately, I survived those tumultuous years. My teenage troubles never escalated to real danger, just enough to infuriate and frustrate my parents. In 1979, I graduated from high school and was accepted to Framingham State College, but only lasted one semester. School was so traumatic for me. I wanted to leave that behind and join the adult world. My next step was to become a bank teller. It was a respectable job, and I was good at it. Within a few years I was married and expecting our first child. My childhood home of little women morphed into the home of My Three Sons. Raising the boys was my purpose. My reason for living. Their well-being was my one and only concern. These active children kept me busy and focused. I rarely thought about my cerebral palsy. When they were young, I ran a home daycare. As they grew, I took a job as an administrative assistant at our local high school. My children attended this school. I feared that my bully names might resurface. Would my boys be known as Gimps kids? To my relief and delight, the name that stuck was \"Mama Betzz\". My name was now a term of endearment! My active boys kept our family busy for 20 years. Unknown to the kids, trouble was brewing in my marriage. Neither of us had the desire to fight for it. With two kids in college and one in high school, Doug and I agreed to separate. I would spend my free time working out and \"walking off\" my divorce. My body and psyche felt strong and renewed. Time passed and in my late 40's I started to experience groin pain. Forty-nine years of walking with a limp had wreaked havoc on my left hip joint. I needed a hip replacement. On a warm April day in 2013, new titanium hardware replaced my overworked bones. After 6 weeks of recovery and physical therapy, I returned to work healthy and refreshed. This renewal would be short-lived. While sitting at work one day, I noticed that my right leg felt numb and when I walked, I needed the bookshelves to support me. A few days later, I reported for my duty as site manager for a varsity soccer game. For years, I would grab my folding chair and binder and oversee high school athletics. This girl who could never participate in sports was tasked with overseeing our young athletes as they competed in theirs. Still numb, I struggled getting on and off the field. After several weeks of this, alarm bells were ringing in my head. Over the next two years, I would fall three times at work. The numbness was constant. It was also becoming difficult for me to lift my leg into my car. I contacted the surgeon who did my hip replacement. He quickly scheduled an appointment and x-rays. He told me that my surgery and follow-up exams indicated no signs of complications. He referred me to a neurologist. This would trigger a merry-go-round of doctors and diagnoses. Here's a sample: Neurologist #1: The MRI indicates that you have lesions, but they look old. Most likely related to your CP. I believe you are suffering from a pinched nerve. Probably the result of a different walking gait after the hip replacement. I'm sending you for physical therapy and to a physiatrist (a physiatrist? This is the first time I've heard this term). Physiatrist: No, it doesn't look like a pinched nerve. It's obvious to me that you have cerebral palsy on your right side. She's not particularly interested when I say that these are new symptoms. In my 50+ years on Earth, no one has ever suspected CP on my right side. She prescribes baclofen and 6 more weeks of physical therapy. She also advises me to put a one-inch lift on my left shoe to compensate for leg length discrepancy. I disagree with her assessment but adhere to her advice. The year is now 2014. My three sons are grown men. Michael is living in Rhode Island engaged to be married. Tommy lives in Florida and Christopher lives in South Carolina. In July, they meet to celebrate Michael's bachelor party. They express serious concern when seeing first-hand how I am struggling. When they return in September for the wedding, their concern elevates to alarm. I am supposed to walk myself down the aisle as part of the wedding party, but during the rehearsal, as I begin the march, it becomes clear to everyone that I am unable to do so with no walls or cane to rely on. An immediate change is made. For stability, I have to forgo the cute new sandals I purchased for the occasion and wear my dirty sneakers instead. I plead with the photographer to make sure my feet are not visible in pictures, and I am grateful that I chose to wear a full-length dress to hide them. My two sons, the best men, walk on either side of me. They offer their arms to me, and I hang on for dear life. I am so very sad but try to hide it because this is the happiest day of Michael's life. As the mother of the groom, I was looking forward to sharing a dance with Michael. He had asked me to select the song. I chose \"My Wish\" by Rascal Flatts. He escorts me to the dance floor. We begin, simply swaying to the beat as he holds me up. It is a tender moment tainted by the stark realization that something is seriously wrong. Fear and devastation wash over me. Both Tommy and Chris decide to move back to Massachusetts, recognizing that I need care. This decision brings all three of my children close to home. They become an integral part of my support system. As the year winds down, my right leg continues to feel numb and that sensation spreads to my abdomen. Walking is getting more difficult. I rely on a quad cane for support. After work, I struggle to get to my car. Once there, I need to hoist my right leg into the vehicle. The spasticity fights me. I tie a scarf around my thigh to use as a hoist. One day, on the road, I realize I can't safely move my right leg from the gas pedal to the brake. Driving is no longer safe. I have no diagnosis and an uncertain future. I am terrified. As a single woman, my job is essential for my finances. I request a leave of absence and am pleased to learn that I have amassed enough sick time to afford several paid months off. On New Year's Day 2015, I woke up with a high fever and flu-like symptoms. I try to stand and move. It's an impossible feat. Home alone and terrified, I reach out to a neighbor. She comes over and waits with me for an ambulance. An MRI reveals new lesions. Finally, years after my first symptom, I have a diagnosis. I have multiple sclerosis. MS appears to have attacked my right leg only. It feels like a cruel twist of fate that I have dual disabilities on opposite sides of my body. The symptoms compete for my attention. I struggle with strong spasms. The ones on my left CP side cause my muscles to recoil. The ones on my right MS side cause my leg to straighten and stiffen to the point of pain. I grow more and more dependent on a wheelchair. Remember that left hand that couldn't play an instrument or type? It also lacks the strength needed to propel me in the manual chair. Eventually, my doctor convinced me to get a power wheelchair. It breaks my heart but provides much-needed independence. I get by. The pandemic shifted the balance. It became impossible to find help, and I was isolated, unable to care for myself. My family was very worried. My neurologist suggested that I look into admission at The Boston Home. This idea overwhelmed me. I could not imagine leaving behind the familiarity of my chosen hometown. Needing the care of a skilled nursing facility left me feeling defeated. Next came a hard-to-hear, tough love conversation with my son. He told me that my loved ones were very worried about me and did not think I should live on my own. This was difficult to hear, but I appreciated his honesty. Begrudgingly, I applied, expecting to be placed on a lengthy waitlist. To my surprise, there was an immediate opening. On a warm August day in 2022, I became a Boston Home resident. Now this girl from the suburbs is learning to be a city girl. I have friends here who encourage me to hop on the \"T\" and explore the wonderful culture around us. I have a dual disability and dual emotions. I allow myself to feel sorrow for what has been a lifetime of challenges. I don't know if it will ever feel completely comfortable living in a skilled nursing facility. I dream of a time when I can return to independence. If that day never comes, I will find joy in new experiences. I celebrate my incredible support system. My Mom and sisters are constant cheerleaders. A few of them join me for lunch once a month after my infusion. My boys visit me often. A tremendous joy has been watching them all become Dads. My family has grown to include 3 loving daughters-in-law and 4 grandchildren. Life is good!",

    "data": "Ana Bess Moyer Bell Drama Therapist, Founder of COAAST (Creating Outreach about Addiction Support Together) By Val Walker Ana Bess Moyer Bell is the founder of COAAST, a non-profit organization in Rhode Island that offers arts-based education and therapeutic programing to address the opioid epidemic, aid in prevention education for teens, and continuing medical education for healthcare professionals. She most recently graduated from New York University with a Masters in Drama Therapy. She currently works as a Drama Therapy consultant for The BETES Organization creating and implementing theater-based programs for families of children diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. She previously worked as a drama therapist at Access Community Health Center, an outpatient substance abuse clinic, in Manhattan, New York. She held a position as drama therapist at the VA Hospital in West Haven Connecticut, and worked with patients in hospice, cancer treatment, and with PTSD diagnoses. From 2013-2014 she volunteered in San Quentin Prison where she co-facilitated group talk therapy with inmates. COAAST is a non-profit 501(c)(3) whose mission is to create an ongoing dialogue about addiction and recovery through arts-based community-engaged programming. COAAST (Creating Outreach about Addiction Support Together) is a community-oriented organization that helps individuals recognize addiction not only affects the addicted person, but also their family. Their programs use this saying as a guide: \"We hurt in relationship, therefore we heal in relationship.\" Val: What sparked your interest in doing theater about the opioid epidemic? Ana Bess: I lost my high school sweetheart to an overdose in 2012, which I thought to be an isolated incident. By 2014, three more of my friends died from addiction. I was suffering from the grief of so much loss along with many others around me. There was a feeling of isolation inside this kind of grief because heroin addiction is stigmatized, and often there are feelings of deep shame. From my own suffering I understood that addiction is a family disease, as well as a community disease. 2014 was the turning point when I realized something bigger was happening--more overdoses were reported that year in New England, the worst ever. Communities were desperate. We needed to share our experiences in a way that brought families, friends and communities together. Because I knew theater could be a safe place to explore our stories together, I believed the timing was right to start a theater project about this crisis. As soon as I became openly vocal about it on Facebook, it seemed like people came out of the woodwork to tell me their story. I inadvertently became the town's story collector. From these stories themes began to arise; shame, silence, guilt, scapegoating, loss...etc. Finally, I sat down and teased out all the salient themes, and used them to write the play, Four Legs to Stand On. Val: How does theater create a safe place for healing? Ana Bess: Theater does two opposing things, both at the same time: It brings you in so you can empathize with the characters, but it also provides distance, so you see their situation in a larger perspective. Sitting in the audience with the physical distance of the stage, we can be deeply touched while gaining a greater perspective all at once. This happens simultaneously, so we're participating in an event in real time, while reflecting on it. Theater asks a lot of us as participants, both in the audience and on stage. Val: You say theater asks a lot of us as participants, to feel and react, but also to see the bigger picture more clearly at the same time. When it comes to the topic of the opioid epidemic, what is it about a performance that heals the grief and suffering? Ana Bess: First, just acknowledging people are suffering from being stigmatized, and suffering alone. This very act of acknowledgment connects us. As the story unfolds on stage, we see how this epidemic has separated and divided us, and how we are isolated in our suffering. Val: It's ironic-- by acknowledging the aloneness of our grief together in a theater, we become connected. Ana Bess: Yes, and by witnessing our own stories, we become more compassionate and empathetic with ourselves. We must start with ourselves. Even subconsciously, we feel a call to action within ourselves. When we go to see a performance we create a supportive community, at least for a brief period in time. This is especially important for people struggling with addiction. Research has shown they are more likely to seek help, enter rehab, and follow through with long-term recovery when they have a supportive community and family. After each of our performances we always provide a 20-30 minute period for the actors to take questions from the audience. Talking together following the performance is a vital part of healing. This offers the audiences a space to process their feelings, tell their own story, and brainstorm what their immediate community can do in terms of social action. We often perform for medical communities, such as Harvard medical staff, the Rhode Island Department of Health, and other healthcare entities. CEUs and CMEs can be provided. Val: I've read terrific reviews of your play, Four Legs to Stand On, which toured this fall throughout Massachusetts. Can you tell us more about this year's highlights with your group, COAAST? Ana Bess: Where do I begin? What all of us as a cast sat with over and over again this fall was the overwhelming amount of loss. Town after town, we were faced with mothers, daughters, uncles, friends, and lovers of those lost to opioid addiction. When we were in Middleborough, there was a mother in the audience whose son had died five days prior to us performing, and I'm not exaggerating in saying that every single person in that sold-out crowd had lost someone to addiction. The devastation this epidemic has caused was so palpable every place we performed, and yet felt so silenced. I learned again the dire need for better and more accessible treatment. Again, over and over, it was glaringly clear how important family and community support is; not only for our addicted ones, but also for those who love them. At our final performance at a gorgeous black box theater in Franklin, one of the audience members pointed to a lack of attendance. If this were another more fashionable disease, he stated, the room would be filled with a line out the door. So, I guess that's what I'm left with: stigma is still our biggest battle. Val: Where will you be performing in 2017? What lies ahead? Ana Bess: I will be using the performance to teach at some Universities this winter, and we have begun booking already for our spring tour. You can find those dates on our website: www.coaast.org. If you are interested in bringing us to your local community theater, hospital, or school, please contact us. Val: If you could sum up why storytelling through theater is vital for you, what would you say? Ana Bess: I believe in the power of storytelling; it is how we make meaning of our lives. Story is a meaning-making tool. Through performing, sharing and witnessing our stories, we're able to uncover what it means to be a human being. It helps us feel less alone, less disconnected, and more understood. Val: This is such important work you are doing. I'm honored and thankful to have spent some time with you today. Ana Bess: Thank you. I've enjoyed it. Ana Bess Moyer suggests these websites for further reading aboutCOAASTand the opioid crisis.

    "data": "On May 23rd, at WBUR's CitySpace, Mike Romano and Genevieve Hammond shared their stories of navigating kidney transplant--Mike as the recipient and Genevieve as the donor. We shared thevideowith you on our blog last month, and will now share their written stories with you as a two-part series. Mike first. By Michael Romano I think sometimes we as humans like to think we have more control over our lives than we really do. We go about our days confidently making decisions as if we are in charge, but many of the situations we encounter are out of our control. Anyone here who has experienced significant health problems knows this all too well. My own experiences with polycystic kidney disease have often left me feeling powerless and wondering if there is much of anything we do have control over. I thought I was healthy for much of my childhood and young adulthood. I grew up in the picturesque part of rural northern New Jersey, surrounded by mountains and cows...far from the smoggy Turnpike and the trashy but endearing-kind-of-trashy Jersey shore. I spent my childhood playing the saxophone, loving school and never pumping my own gas--that's against the law in New Jersey. I moved to Boston in 2002--to this very street in fact--to attend Boston University where I studied biology and education. I went to grad school across the river at Harvard, and then started teaching. I've been teaching high school biology, marine biology and chemistry at the same suburban high school for the past twelve years, save last year when I took a sabbatical to work at NASA in Washington, DC. I came back from NASA to get a kidney. I was diagnosed six years ago with polycystic kidney disease (PKD). It's a genetic condition where as time goes on, cysts grow on the kidneys, limiting their ability to filter your blood and eventually leading to total kidney failure. I actually found out I had PKD as somewhat of a fluke...there was no family history of it, and patients don't usually show many symptoms until your kidneys fail and it's too late. One symptom is high blood pressure, which I did have in my early twenties, but my doctor chalked it up to \"family history\" and put me on an ACE inhibitor to keep it at bay. I went to the emergency room on the eve of my 28th birthday because something wasn't right--I was having arm pain, chest pain, shortness of breath...I self-diagnosed this as a heart attack by reading WebMD, which is apparently a pretty common thing among millennials based on the number of memes I've seen about this. It definitely wasn't a heart attack, but the symptoms were caused by abnormal blood chemistry that was kidney related. It's funny thinking back to that day--the doctor wanted to keep me overnight for tests and observations, but I protested because the next day was my birthday and I had reservations at Oleana. Locals will agree--totally disappointing to have to miss that! But she insisted, especially considering that something serious might be wrong with my kidneys. One kidney ultrasound later, the characteristic kidney cysts of PKD were made visible and I was officially diagnosed with PKD. That high blood pressure I'd been treating? A classic symptom of PKD. (Luckily, the diagnosis and discharge came a few hours before dinner, which was delicious by the way.) The next few years were marked by semi-annual nephrologist visits. They largely went the same each time...a slight decrease in my kidney filtration rate (bad), an ominous warning about the eventual renal failure I would experience and impending need for a transplant, and a rebooking for a follow-up in six months. Then every three months. I actually really liked my nephrologist--he was personable, compassionate, and talked to me like an educated person--he knew that I was reading up on my disease (and in primary literature--not on WebMD). These visits were emotionally-draining too though, because his recommendations and diagnoses sounded overly serious for how personally healthy I still felt. I didn't *feel* like a sick person, you know? I'm not sure healthy people really have a concept of what it means to be a \"sick person\" anyway. We spend time with family members in the hospital. We see news stories about communities rallying around children in hospital beds hooked up to IVs, or pictures on Facebook of a woman wearing a bandana to cover her head that has gone bald from chemotherapy--that's a sick person. That's not me...I just had high blood pressure, right? As time went on I did start to feel some physical symptoms though. As my kidneys became less able to filter out my blood, my blood filled with \"junk\" and this made me really tired. I also had a few flare-ups of gout--a really painful arthritis that can be caused by kidney disease. I was spending my summers teaching in Hong Kong, and the long flights became more arduous as my feet and legs swelled. My last trip to Hong Kong in 2017 was nothing short of a cluster...my feet were so swollen that I couldn't wear shoes, ended up in a Hong Kong emergency room, and then had to teach on crutches for a few days. I knew a transplant was imminent...I was just hoping I could postpone it...well...indefinitely, you know? I was compartmentalizing my illness, which was easy to do because I still mostly felt fine, and no one could tell me when my kidneys would ultimately fail...it could be a year it could be a decade or more. Part of this uncertainty came from my GFR, which stands for \"glomerular filtration rate.\" This is an indicator of how well your kidneys are filtering and working, which can be determined from a blood test. A normal, healthy GFR is 59 or greater. Mine had been hovering in the mid-20s for a few years. I knew that when I dropped below 20 I would qualify to be listed on the National Kidney Registry and real discussions of a kidney transplant could begin. This happened in January of 2017, and then it all finally seemed real. I didn't realize my wait for a deceased kidney would be many years in Massachusetts. I have type O blood, which is highly desirable for blood and organ donations (if I were the donor), because it is a blood type that is highly compatible in many people, regardless of their blood type. The flip side of that, however, is that type O individuals can *only* receive blood and kidneys from other type O people, making the wait for type O kidneys exceedingly long--five or six years. I started looking for a living donor, because if my kidneys totally failed before finding a donor, I would have to go on dialysis or I would die. Dialysis is crappy. It takes a huge physical toll on your body. It requires hours of treatment three days a week, severely limiting your ability to travel, or just live an independent life. It's also not a permanent solution, because if you stop dialysis you will ultimately die. I didn't want this, not in my early 30s. I started looking for a kidney among family members, but there were no healthy type O matches. This was frustrating because so many of my family members wanted to donate, knowing that you only need one healthy kidney to live a long, healthy life. After a year of looking and waiting and watching my GFR tick down, in January of 2018 I took to social media to ask for a kidney. The results were totally overwhelming. My Facebook post went viral, mostly being shared by friends, colleagues and former students. With all of those shares, I had over 60 type O people submit applications to be my donor! The hospital couldn't tell me the names of those who submitted applications because of privacy laws, but people told me themselves: friends, colleagues, former students, parents of students, former classmates from when I went to high school, parishioners from my parents' church...just so many generous and brave people. I met Genevieve 12 years ago. She and I teach at the same high school, and while our classrooms were on opposite sides of the building when we met (she taught English and I taught biology at the time), over the years we've become good friends through co-advising the Student Council, chaperoning dances together, working as building reps for the teachers' union and serving on committees together. I fondly remember working with Genevieve on a committee charged with re-writing our school's mission statement several years ago. I had some pretty eloquent suggestions for our new mission statement, and Genevieve called me a \"wordsmith.\" That's high praise coming from an English teacher! Ultimately all of my mission statement suggestions were ignored, but to this day, it's one of the nicest compliments I've ever received. It turns out this friend who called me a \"wordsmith\" a decade earlier saw my Facebook post, and after months of testing turned out to be a very close kidney match, and was willing--nay, excited--to donate one to me! I remember the conversation Genevieve and I had about the transplant timeline once the process was finalized--it was like we were scheduling a coffee date. \"How about summer?\" \"Actually, I have a trip planned. Maybe early fall?\" \"Well, we should get the school year rolling at least...maybe October?\" \"I have a wedding the second week--could we shoot for the third week?\" And like that, we scheduled this crucially-important medical procedure for October 25th, almost seven months ago today! The transplant itself was certainly scary, and I remember the day pretty vividly. I showed up to the perioperative area at 8am, changed into my ugly blue transplant gown, and met a lot of faces I would see over and over throughout the day like the surgeon, the anesthesiology team, and the nurses. I had stopped eating the night before and stopped drinking at 7am, so I was hungry, thirsty, nervous and ornery. To add to my unease, I was hoping to see Genevieve that morning, but our paths didn't cross. I was really frustrated by this, especially because I knew she was going under the knife first. By 9:30 I was being wheeled through the bowels of the hospital to the operating room. My anesthesiologist was wearing a Red Sox skull cap--a wicked Boston thing to witness. There were SO many scissors in the operating room, but I was reassured they were not all for me. In fact, this was one of the last things I remember--I was unconscious before they even put the oxygen mask on. I didn't even get to the counting backwards, which to be honest was kind of disappointing. The next thing I know it was 7pm and I was waking up in my recovery room. I didn't feel much pain at first (drugs) but I also didn't feel great (also drugs), but I was told the kidney was working great and I was making beautiful urine, and honestly that's the nicest thing anyone had said to me in a few days, so it was quite the compliment. Genevieve was recovering on the same floor, and I finally got to see her the next day. I remember feeling incredibly grateful walking over to see her. It was also incredibly hard to walk--huge incision, catheter in, hooked up to IVs, lots of pain--but I felt relieved it was over, and incredibly close to someone who had always been a good friend. Genevieve's recovery was so fast. It was such a positive light when I would go for a walk around the transplant floor and see her smiling face. Mine was a little bumpy. The kidney they removed from me was very large and inflamed. They had to take a lot more tissue out than expected, and as a result I developed an ileus, which essentially means my digestive system shut down. I started vomiting so they inserted a tube through my nose into my stomach that sucked out over a liter of grossness over a couple days. I don't think I'd felt this physically miserable before. It hurt to sleep, to move and I couldn't eat. I also ended up being allergic to one of my medicines, so I had some hives. Ironically, I also had one last painful post-transplant gout attack. The victories were pretty sweet though. You forget what an accomplishment something like a catheter removal is! I was discharged a week after the transplant on Halloween. In remember getting a small cup of M&Ms with my lunch that day, and watching the Red Sox victory parade on TV while waiting to be discharged. I was relieved to finally be home and have my parents there to help me, though recovery would continue to be slow and difficult. Other small victories like taking a shower, going to the bathroom without pain, walking without pain, sleeping through the night, lifting groceries, being out in public, returning to work, and feeling like a normal, healthy person again really made me reflect on the entire process. The regimen of anti-rejection drugs is much more manageable than I imagined they would be, and the bloodwork and follow-up visits have significantly reduced in frequency. My immune system is compromised, of course, but even that has noticeably regained strength from right after the transplant. So I do notice a positive physical improvement, and my attitude has improved as well. I feel like I have a new lease on life--a chance to live a long, healthy, productive life that wouldn't have been possible without Genevieve's kidney. I feel like I have a responsibility to help other patients use resources like social media to find a donor. I recently spoke on a panel to a group of pre-transplant recipients, and continue to volunteer for National Kidney Foundation walks. Did you know that my transplant and associated costs were in excess of $300,000? Fortunately I have good health care, and paid less than $2,000. Unfortunately, many Americans don't have this luxury. It shouldn't be a luxury, though, it should be a right. Genevieve and I have been using our platform as teachers to spread awareness about living organ donation as well. People have asked if it's weird seeing my kidney donor now. Some friends had encouraged me to find a donor that I don't know. What happens of something goes wrong? Will I forever feel indebted to her? In fact, it's one of the greatest blessings to see her walking down the hall at school. Colleagues have shared how special it is to see us together, and how it gives them hope. We even have our photograph in the yearbook together, as our story has inspired students too. It's a pretty special feeling knowing that she so selflessly saved my life, and I get to share this bond with her that most people will not ever get to experience. I do feel a greater sense of responsibility now--I have to do something good with this opportunity she gave me. I think that's why opportunities like this to share our story are so important. Icanshare our story, so I must. It's hard to thank someone who donates an organ to you. It's hard to find the right words to say, even for a wordsmith. My gratitude is there in many forms, however: the occasional text asking her to coffee, the soft smile on my face when I find her in the break room between classes, the messages of reassurance I share with other pre-transplant recipients, and the interactions with my family and friends that I can now spend many more healthy years with. I never would have known a decade ago at those Student Council dances or teacher meetings what future bond we would ultimately share, but that's the essence of the human experience. We can't control many aspects of our own health, or predict what the future holds. We can, however, cultivate friendships with those random people we meet at work. We can express gratitude to those who help us along when we're struggling physically and emotionally. We can share our hardships and experiences with others, especially those going through similar health challenges to make them feel less anxious. We can also never really know what hardships our friends and colleagues might be facing in their personal lives, so we can practice patience and empathy in our interactions with others. We can be grateful for the things wecancontrol and the challenges we don't have to face. And most importantly we can share our stories--in doing so we are able to reshape our perspectives on life and the importance of the relationships we forge in it.",

    "data": "Questions by Val Walker Answers by Sarah Merrill Sarah is a personal historian and owner of Merrill Memoirs (www.memoirsbymerrill.com). Since 2010, she has been assisting individuals, families and small businesses in recounting, recording, and preserving their stories. Sarah works with a talented genealogist to complete family research, and she contracts with a professional book designer to present her clients' stories and photographs in beautiful books. She also teaches memoir writing workshops and serves as an editor for people writing their own memoirs of family histories. Sarah earned her undergraduate degree with high honors in literature and creative writing at Middlebury College, Vermont, and completed graduate work in oral history and nonfiction writing at the Salt Institute for Documentary Studies in Maine. She spent ten years in journalism before launching her personal history business. Introduction Have you ever engaged in a leisurely conversation with someone who not only listened to your story, but was fascinated in every bit of it? Indeed, your listener beckoned you to unearth memories that perhaps you had not thought about in years? Sarah Merrill is this kind of listener. With genuine curiosity, she invites you to dive into all the details of a life story and discover the long-forgotten treasures that may have been buried for decades. With Sarah, your story's details are for excavating, examining, saving, and savoring. And later, after selecting your stories, she artfully crafts a narrative of your life to create a memoir or a family history book, or more loosely, a collection of personal stories on a beloved topic. This intricate and complex work is generally what a personal historian such as Sarah does. Experienced personal historians combine the expertise of active listening, archiving of artifacts, genealogy, narrative writing, ghost-writing, book production, self-publishing, and more. In the following interview with Sarah, I hope to introduce readers to the vital work field of personal history. Val: A personal historian needs to be talented at writing as well as adept at engaging people and listening--and yet, needs to be impeccably accurate and organized. This is a very particular mix of gifts to have. How did you get started at this? My interest in collecting stories and memories actually started when I was just a kid. I seem to have been born nostalgic! I always kept diaries and scrapbooks and saved every letter I ever received. I also was very enamored of my grandparents. I really wish I'd been enlightened enough to record their stories while they were still here. This is one of my regrets and part of what powered my inspiration to become a personal historian. In addition to being a collector and memory keeper, I was a storyteller. I read a great deal and I wrote stories all the time. I studied fiction writing in college and those skills are absolutely employed when I'm writing memoir and family history. In addition to accuracy, an important goal is for the narrative to be an engaging read! Val: Could you tell me more about what is involved when you listen to peoples' stories in your work? How do you get them to relax and delve into their recollections with such vivid detail? As personal historians, we are very client focused in our work. Listening is about building trust. Trust is key. This means I don't want to force the narrative or push someone to get to the point. Instead, I gently allow them to discover and explore as they travel back in time. I often spend upwards of eight hours with my clients, spread over a few days, so they have ample time to cover a lot of ground. In telling their stories freely, without trying to meet any external criteria, my clients have the control,theychoose what to share. In some cases, the experience of sharing a story can be enlightening as well as enriching. And sometimes, they'll tell a story just to get it off their chest, but then decide not to include it in the final product. Val: This reminds me of an important technique in psychology and counseling, developed by Alfred Adler. Adlerian approaches are invested in early childhood recollections and how we find meaning and wisdom in these old narratives. I believe at different times in our lives, we can revisit our stories and discovernewtakeaways by seeing details or patterns we'd never noticed. We can look at a relationship over time and see patterns or healing. We can even look at a trauma in new ways and sometimes find healing. It's important to point out that I am not anything like a therapist. I'm more like a guide on a journey of life review. And life review has many, many benefits. Though some topics may be too difficult, and I always let people know it is completely fine to leave them out. Val: It sounds deeply meaningful to help people value their stories ashistory. My work is rewarding on multiple fronts. We can help clients understand the impact of peoples' struggles and challenges in their families over the decades. In reviewing our life stories, we can sometimes more clearly see the influences that people have had on us, on our families, our communities over time. We can see the impact we've had on others around us. We can see our own challenges from a new perspective. Our children and grandchildren can be enriched by what our family members have faced and battled through generations. Val: Is the field of personal history becoming more popular? The field of personal history is still not well known--not yet, really. But fortunately, interest in the field of genealogy has greatly increased in recent years. And in the first year or so of the pandemic, people had more time to reflect. Folks pulled out photo albums or downloaded a genealogy app. The interest in genealogy has sparked people to learn more about their ancestors and families and has helped lead them to the field of personal history and writing memoirs. But there is a significant difference between genealogy and personal history. Certainly, personal history complements and includes genealogy. I work closely with a genealogist in my business. Val: When did you actually discover there was such a thing as personal history and give yourself a professional name, \"personal historian?\" At some point, I was aware that I wanted to work with individuals and families to record their stories, but I did not know there was a field called \"personal history\" or that others were already doing this. I'd volunteered in a nursing home helping elders write their memoirs and it struck me then how rewarding it was. Especially visiting these fairly isolated and lonely elders and actively listening to them, taking an interest in their lives. Around 12 years ago, when I was working as a journalist and a medical writer, I learned through a newspaper article of a man who was working as a personal historian - and it all just clicked into place. He was gracious enough to meet with me and discuss his business model. And from there, my dream gradually became a reality. I slowly built my business as a professional personal historian with my company Merrill Memoirs. I've been doing it full time for about 10 years and have written dozens of memoirs and family histories. Val: What types of people come to you for your services? I'm either hired by the individual themselves - typically aged 60 to 100 - or by their adult children or their grandchildren, who want the stories recorded. People are realizing they need to get their loved one's stories recorded before they are gone. Sometimes, the older generations may be reluctant to be the center of attention like this. I sometimes hear, \"Why would anyone want my stories? I'm not interesting!\" But truly, once they begin the story sharing process, they realize how wonderful it can be. I often have people express disappointment when our interviews are completed.

    "data": "Laura Delanogrew up in a wealthy Connecticut suburb in a family of high achievers. She was a nationally ranked squash player and student body president. But in her teen years, life got more complicated as she struggled with her own identity and felt burdened by the pressures she felt from her environment. She started to act out, cut herself, and was sent to a psychiatrist by her parents. At 14, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed powerful psychiatric drugs, including the mood stabilizer Depakote and Prozac. With medication side effects leading to additional problems and \"symptoms\" which in turn led to more medications, Laura says she began to lose herself. She was defined by the diagnoses she continued to collect: bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, substance abuse disorder and binge eating disorder. She was taking up to five psychoactive substances at a time, including an anti-depressant, an anti-psychotic, a mood stabilizer and an anxiolytic (anti-anxiety agent). Her early twenties were marked by multiple psychiatric hospitalizations and ultimately a suicide attempt. Her only identity was a self-described \"professional mental patient.\" But then things began to change. Over five years ago, Laura weaned herself off psychiatric drugs and shed her diagnostic labels. For her, this has been a spiritual journey involving the cultivation of self-acceptance, self-love and honesty. \"It is the hardest thing I have ever done,\" she says, but she now feels happier, more connected and more engaged in the world. Personally, I have been moved by Laura's story. As a practicing internist, I often rely on psychiatric diagnoses and medications. In my clinical practice, I have seen psychiatric medications reduce suffering and save lives. But it has been useful to step back and reconsider my filter on these issues. From day one of medical training, we are taught to fit our patients into neat diagnostic categories whenever possible. The goal of our patient interactions, we learn, is to sift through and distill all that we see and hear in order to hone in on a diagnosis. This categorization can be helpful in directing our care, of course, but it can also be limiting, and even dangerous. Rarely does a diagnosis fit perfectly, yet all too often in our culture one's diagnosis becomes indistinguishable from one's identity. Labels have power. With mental illness, diagnostic criteria are particularly difficult to define and identify. Truthfully, our current understanding of the brain and the biochemistry behind mental illness is limited. There are no clear markers to measure and quantify. Instead, we must rely on subjective interpretation of behavior. And yet, psychiatric labels abound. It is estimated thatone in four adults, or approximately 61.5 million individuals, and one in five teens between the ages of 13 and 18, meets criteria for a diagnosis of mental illness within a given year. Laura would say that the medical establishment often miscategorizes healthy struggling as pathology, and that this is especially true in adolescence, when some degree of acting out is to be expected. She believes this is what happened to her. Today, more than 20% of Americans regularly take psychotropic medications--chemical substances that alter brain chemistry and function, and ultimately emotions and behavior. In 2010, sale of such medications amounted to more thanseventy billion dollarsin the US, and prescription rates continue to climb for both children and adults. Again, our scientific understanding of how these medications work is shockingly poor. It has something to do with a soup of neurotransmitters--serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine--but we haven't nailed down the exact mechanisms of action. Can we really say with complete confidence that mental illness is primarily the cause of chemical imbalance in the brain? I don't think so. Not yet anyway. Moreover, the list of negative side-effects of these medications seems almost endless--weight gain, cognitive impairment, drowsiness, dry mouth, higher rates of diabetes, increased suicidality, sexual dysfunction to name a few--and studies suggest that long term use of such substances may actually lead to increased disability over time. Most concerning of all is the increasing and often \"off-label\" (i.e., not FDA approved) use of suchmedications in children. For instance, the number of children receiving atypical, or second generation, anti-psychotics doubled between 2001 and 2010. Disturbingly,children on Medicaidare four times more likely to receive these drugs than kids with private insurance. What are we doing to these developing brains? Again, we really don't know. I am not suggesting that all psychiatric diagnoses are wrong, or that every one on psychiatric drugs should stop taking them. Even Laura would say that it would be dangerous to stop taking these drugs abruptly, without a lot of planning, personal reflection, and supports in place. I still believe that psychiatric drugs can be helpful at times, and I will continue to prescribe them, but I will do so less frequently and with more awareness and caution. All of us, and doctors in particular, need to ask questions about our current frameworks of understanding and about our assumptions. Laura's story has reminded me of this. Every patient is unique, and there is still so much we don't know. A version of this story was originally published on WBUR CommonHealth Blog March 16th, 2016.

    "data": "Artist Statement When I was thirteen years old, my doctor put me in a neck brace and said it would not last long. Eleven years later, I am still navigating extreme oscillations of health while feeling stigmatized and misunderstood. I was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) on 11/11/11. Although Ankylosing Spondylitis is a common disease, it remains unseen and unknown by both the public and medical practitioners. My art is how I make my story visible. My paintings employ layers of text and image to capture the multifaceted identities we have as patients. Patients living with chronic, incurable diseases rarely fit into healthy-sick binaries. With illnesses often invisible and oscillating in symptoms and magnitude, patients find themselves in limbo, betwixt and between sick and healthy. By creating a third box, an \"other,\" I aim to make this complex identity visible. In my photography, I show the intersection between the finite and the infinite nature of chronic disease. These body scans are dissected into disconnected body parts: my brain, my spine, my heart, my vertebra. As a patient, I have often felt that my body parts are seen as fragments to be analyzed in separate glass boxes. However, in sum, my boxes represent the connections between my body and mind. Biography Sal Marx is a multimedia artist who works to illuminate human experiences with chronic disease and advocate for patient-centered change. Living with Ankylosing Spondylitis, an invisible, underrepresented disease, she uses her personal story as a visual data point in the context of a much broader healthcare crisis. Marx studied Public Policy, Psychology, and Media Studies at Pomona College. She is based in Brooklyn, NY.",

    "data": "Dear Andy, Wow, it's been a while since we last spoke. I'm about to start my junior year--can you believe that? It still seems like yesterday that you and I met through South Boston Afterschool. On the T-ride to South Boston, we talked in Chinese (I had just started; you helped me with my tones). We talked about girls (we talked a lot about girls). And sometimes we talked about more serious things. About how we were so afraid to fail, about how we constantly felt pulled in all directions. About how hopeless we felt. When you quit South Boston Afterschool, I just figured it was a sophomore slump. Maybe your economics tutorial was taking up too much of your time, or maybe you were working on a new start-up, trying to be the next Mark Zuckerberg. You were stressed out the last time I saw you. I wasn't too worried, though. I thought what everyone else here thinks: Junior year will be better than sophomore year. Senior year might be a bit tougher because of job searching, but you'll be set after that. You'll be a Harvard grad the rest of your life. But then you jumped off a tower in downtown Boston. I thought wrong. Andy, I spent a long time trying to figure out how to write this letter. It's been on my mind every single day now for months. I almost gave up, because the words just wouldn't come to me. It was too painful to express. Then, in May, my best friend since we were babies ended his own life. He had just gotten into Georgia Tech. He had so much talent. He had such an incredible life ahead of him. His mom found his body. They couldn't show it at the service. His death inspired me to write this to you. Because it's not just him, and it's not just you. Writing this next part terrifies me, Andy. I'm scared because we live in a world where I can't even write this letter without knowing in my heart that no matter what people will say, they will look at me differently. I want to make a big impact after I graduate, but I know that publicly discussing my complicated history with mental health--a conversation that should not be any more damning than talking about asthma or a heart condition--might prevent me from doing this. But that is exactly why I have to write this letter. It is time for us to reconcile with the reality of the world that we live in. It is time for me to say now what I should have told you before: You are not alone. I should have told you about fifth grade, when I would stay up every single night thinking terrible thoughts. I had to make sure once, twice, three, four, five times that our doors and windows were locked, because I had to be sure. I had to know that no one would come in and slit my parents' throats, and then beat my head in with a baseball bat. I should have told you about sixth grade, when I touched flowers, and leaves, and people's hair. My classmates did not understand, so they signed a petition asking me to stop. They gave it to the teacher, who presented it to me. Even today I remember the hurt and shame I felt when I saw the names of so many friends written on that piece of paper. They didn't know that I could not help it; they did not know that it was outside of my control. I should have told you about seventh grade, when germs consumed me. Bacteria crawled all over my body and inside my mouth. I would go to the bathroom repeatedly in the middle of class to frantically rinse my mouth and scrub my hands. When my best friend sneezed on me to see my reaction, and another spat in my juice and forced me to drink it, and another threw meat at me because she knew I was a vegetarian. I wondered if I had any friends at all. Maybe they were just pretending to like me because I was so funny to watch. I felt worthless; I felt hopeless; I felt powerless. I felt like I didn't deserve to live. But more important than any of that, Andy, I should have told you about how finally enough was enough. My mom got me help. She got me help, even when my teacher asked, \"Why does he need therapy? He makes all A's--he'll be fine.\" My mom replied, \"I will be sure to write on his tombstone that he had all A's after he kills himself because he hates his brain.\" She knew what too few understand, that objective achievement means very little when life is nothing but shame and darkness. Because of her intervention, I acquired tools to deal with my compulsions, to say \"It Don't Matter\" until it really did not matter. Overcoming my compulsions was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it was worth it. I'm here today Andy, writing this letter to you, because my mom got me help. Andy, I am sorry that I never told you about my middle school self. And I am sorry that I never told you how therapy empowered me to reclaim the beauty in life. But I hope this letter to you will help change things for others. I hope it will convince someone who is like me all those years ago to find the support that they need. I hope it will encourage someone like me now--too busy with their midterms, their finals, and their papers--to check in on a friend. I hope it will encourage us as a community to fight against the stigma surrounding mental health issues both in our college and in our nation. And most of all, I am sorry that we live in a society where we could not talk openly to each other. I miss you more than you can know, Andy. By relating this story--of what I did wrong with you, and what my mom did right with me--I want us to make a difference in the world. Then I will know that I am doing your memory proud. Will Originally published in the Harvard Crimson, September 2, 2015 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In Reflection: Will's thoughts on the process of writing and publishing this letter At first, writing Dear Andy was pure catharsis. It was also extremely difficult. For years I had not been able to even talk about my history with mental health and the tragedies of my friends' suicides. To put my feelings into words for thousands of people to see would have been unthinkable to me. But after receiving support from my friends and my fraternity brothers, I found the voice to write my article. As a result of the attention that my article received, I am now working with a number of organizations on and off campus as well as Harvard administrators to improve mental health services. The feedback I have received since writing Dear Andy has inspired me to fight for mental health reform, both on campus and beyond. This has become my passion, and I am not going to give up until I have done everything in my power to change things. William F.

    "data": "Dr.Rita Charon, founder of Narrative Medicine, cares deeply about how patients' stories are told. She believes there are two ways healthcare providers can tell the stories of their patients: with data derived from test results and quantifiable statistics, or with deep understanding of that patient's experience, derived from generous listening. Rita observes: \"I'm sure many patients have the experience of that first kind of storytelling: 'They don't care who I am, they just care what my A1C is.' But then in the very same place, there's this other kind, where (a healthcare provider) is not only able to but is rewarded for really coming to understand how to listen to the deeply personal, affective, emotional aspects of not just living, being sick, and of dying.\" But how can providers incorporate this second kind of storytelling into their daily medical practices? Ronald Schleifer and Jerry B. Vannatta, co-authors ofThe Chief Concern of Medicine: The Integration of the Medical Humanities and Narrative Knowledge into Medical Practices, offer accessible suggestions for clinicians who want to prioritize their patient's story in their caregiving. Changes in how providers offer and patients receive care can start with simple but significant technical aspects of storytelling in healthcare: how trainees are taught to write. Usually, hospital notes begin with a patient's \"Chief Complaint\": \"My asthma is back\" or \"I have chest pain\" or \"I fell and hurt my back.\" Schleifer and Vannatta recommend in their book that in addition to a \"Chief Complaint\", providers also ask for their patient's \"Chief Concern\" - which is markedly different. This year, for the first time, Rita asked the four medical students she mentored to do just that, and was pleased to see that they took the task of registering a chief concern very seriously. Even at this quite technical level, it is clear \"how much it matters how these young kids - 2nd year medical students - are learning how to tell stories.\" The contrasts evident between the complaint and the concern in the examples Rita's students recorded struck me as nothing short of poetic: Chief complaint: \"Belly pain.\"Chief concern: \"I hope my cancer's not back.\" Chief complaint: \"Relapse of pancreatic cancer.\"Chief concern: \"Is it now that I'm going to die? Chief complaint: \"Shortness of breath.\"Chief concern: \"Suffocation.\" Chief complaint: \"Shortness of breath.\"Chief concern: \"I really don't want to be in the hospital again.\" Chief complaint: \"Transfer from the coronary care unit.\"Chief concern: \"I don't understand what has happened to me.\" Chief complaint: \"I was not making any sense and was confused.\"Chief concern: \"I want to take care of my grandchildren.\" It deeply impresses me how easy yet meaningful it is to inquire about a patient's chief concern. It opens up the possibility of a different degree of trust between patient and provider. But just what should students do when they hear their patient's chief concern? \"Tune in!\" Rita declared. \"Notice the lived experiences and implications of an illness serious enough to get put in the hospital. And because we (ask about the chief concern) right up at the front, (providers) are able - maybe - to pay attention to the deep existential fears.\" Rita feels real optimism about this technique: \"It's not like the doctors don't want to do this, it's just that they've never been asked to...\" or shown how, until now, through narrative medicine training. Narrative medicine cultivates the development of foresight, the ability to tune in and pay attention. As evident in Rita's stories about generous listening and asking patients about their chief concern, it's sometimes the seemingly small gestures that can make all the difference in how clinicians hear, and care, and practice being with. But it's important to remember that caring for patients' stories isn't easy. Rita acknowledged the challenge in what she asks her medical students to do: \"It's not just: 'Oh yeah, don't forget, get the patient's story...'\" It's about more than just \"getting the story\". It's about \"rolling up your sleeves, and getting yourself in a position of confronting the situation' the patient lives.\" Even Rita admits: \"There are a lot of things I learn that I wish I didn't know.\" I imagine how overwhelmed caregivers must feel when confronting the unsanitized, scary, disheartening reality their patients live. But increasingly, providers are discovering that to bear witness to a patient's whole story, they can better understand and thereby meet their patient's needs. Rita says, when it comes down to it, \"You don't need somebody who's going to put their hands in front of their face and say 'Don't tell me about that...' You don't need that. You need someone who will appreciate the magnitude of what you're talking about. And who can then maybe do something on your behalf.\" We all need our magnitudes to be acknowledged and honored, because we are not only conglomerations of numerical data, we are people with complicated, unique, and profound stories. Rita Charon, MD, PhD, is Professor of Clinical Medicine and Executive Director of the Program in Narrative Medicine at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. She directs the Humanities and Medicine curriculum for P&S and teaches literature, narrative ethics, and medical interviewing. She also has a primary care practice at Presbyterian Hospital. TEDxAtlanta Talk:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24kHX2HtU3o I have experienced the powerful effect stories have in healing as both a patient and as a caregiver in the role of a full-spectrum doula, which involves supporting women through abortion, miscarriage, and fetal loss. As a graduate of the Narrative Medicine master's program at Columbia University, my driving mission in life is to elicit, honor, and attend to stories. I am the Assistant Director of theCenter for Narrative Practice, which provides people with deep critical training in how stories work and trains them to apply this knowledge to everyday life by using narrative practice, creative arts, and the study of story. I also curate an oral narrative project called \"Inside Stories: Medical Student Experiences\", for which I interview medical students about their experiences in medical school with the intention to provide a platform for their own person healing, self-realization and empowerment through the sharing and receiving of personal stories.

    "data": "By Annie Brewster Daniel and I went to the same private school I attended for high school. I was older by a few years and don't remember him well, but he seemed like a happy enough member of our school community. It wasn't until last year, 30 years after graduating, that I learned about the abuse: In middle school, he was molested by an English teacher. Students, faculty and administrators stood by, most of us oblivious but some aware, all silent and all somehow complicit. Now 45, Daniel shares his story with strength and compassion, speaking out straightforwardly and unapologetically about this trauma and the effects it had on his health. He has not only recovered, but is also helping other individuals who have experienced similar abuse, or are at risk of it. Trauma associated with the abuse of a student by a teacher is especially insidious, as the perpetrator is often a respected authority figure, someone the student wants to please, typically held in high regard. For Daniel, it was difficult even to label what was going on as abuse. Instead, unconsciously, he internalized shame. Years of depression and anxiety ensued, and an ongoing journey of recovery. Today, Daniel says that the struggles he has faced, though unwanted, have made him stronger, and ultimately healthier, by encouraging depth of perspective, self-knowledge, resilience and empathy. Recentreporting by the Boston Globehas highlighted the prevalence of sexual misconduct by staff at New England prep schools, with over 100 private schools identified as potentially involved in such incidents over the past 25 years, and more than 300 alleged victims coming forward. In most cases, like Daniel's, school administrators did not intervene to stop the abuse when they should have. Allegations were not taken seriously, and abuse survivors are justifiably angry. But Daniel would say that our school responded admirably, with compassion, respect and action, when he approached administrators regarding his abuse a decade ago -- more than 18 years after it occurred. The school, with Daniel's help, has become a role model in guiding other schools through this process. Daniel recently brought a civil suit against his abuser, and is satisfied with its settlement. Recentchanges in the lawextending the statute of limitations on sexual abuse of minors allowed him to bring the suit, and still more such legal changesare likely in the coming months. Daniel says that recovery, both from depression and trauma, is non-linear and involves slowly naming and making sense of what has happened.With time, he has learned to integrate the complexity of his situation, to appreciate his vulnerability and his strength. He is a survivor of trauma, and so much more. No one part defines him. In this acceptance, he is whole. Originally posted on the WBUR CommonHealth Blog on December 28th, 2016",

Gaynell, a nurse at a long-term rehabilitation facility, feels certain she was exposed to COVID-19 at work. As the facility was hit hard by the virus, many of the other nurses--some sick with it and some afraid of catching it--stopped showing up at work. Gaynell's responsibilities increased dramatically. She cared for many sick patients and eventually fell ill herself, despite her best efforts to protect herself. When her symptoms made it impossible for her to go back to work, she applied for workers' compensation, but administrators responded that her illness had been \"community acquired\" and denied her claim. At the time, Gaynell was raising her twelve-year-old grandson alone. She had bills and rent to pay; she had to put food on the table. Still, in this flawed and deeply unjust system, she was offered no accommodations at work and no financial support. \"I was never one to just sit back and collect,\" said Gaynell. \"I have worked since I was thirteen years-old. \"When she finally applied for unemployment, she felt stereotyped as someone trying to take advantage of the system. She was deemed ineligible, and ultimately her case was sent to the fraud department due to confusion over her name. She had applied for unemployment once before, more than twenty years prior, under her married name, and now she was applying under her birth name. She found herself going in circles, dealing with many \"nasty\" people on the phone and hitting dead ends. The process took persistence, not to mention time and money. She was required to send for her birth certificate as proof. \"It's not possible for everyone to trace their roots,\" she said, \"and forget about being undocumented.\" Ultimately, it took help from a state legislator to finally get her claim approved. Gaynell recognizes that her education and connections in the community helped her to navigate the system, and she is very clear on the fact that many people in her community don't have such resources. Gaynell isn't afraid to be assertive, but still, the process was exhausting, and she nearly gave up many times. Her story underlines how the impacts of entrenched racism--poverty, lack of access to education, and bias in the criminal justice system, just to name a few--amplifies the dire impact of COVID-19 on people of color. ***Adapted fromThe Healing Power of Storytelling: Using Personal Narrative to Navigate Illness, Trauma, and Loss.By Annie Brewster and Rachel Zimmerman. 2021.",

I think about Sam, what he says, and what he actually means. Sam has made multiple attempts to kill himself. He's had a tough life, and I won't attempt to explain the root of it all. He accepts his pain as constant, and he does so without drama. He fits the criteria of involuntary commitment because he's at what's considered an \"unacceptably high risk\" of hurting himself if he's discharged, and he's waiting for placement at a state hospital, where he'll be for an undetermined amount of time. Sam keeps asking what the point is, saying that he'll kill himself when he leaves, that he doesn't envision a future for himself. Still, he repeats all the things he knows will keep him here. Why does he set himself up to be institutionalized, if he really wants to leave and end it? Does he want help, but is so incapable of asking for it, that he'll say whatever will compel us to keep him here? How can we connect to him, if that's the case? At first glance, Sam looked to me like a lot of teenagers do, with this angst sort of hovering over him, sulking around with huge headphones on and refusing to show up to morning rounds. I'd catch him at groups, sitting with his hands glued in his pockets or folded against his chest. When I say Sam is smart, I mean I think Sam is probably a lot smarter than me. He's cynical, with a sort of wisdom and a dry humor that ages him and makes him easy to relate to. Sam will laugh at you when he knows you're trying to \"doctor\" him, an effective way to puncture and deflate your ballooned ego. He brightened up a little while we played scrabble during group one afternoon, making me think for a moment, I don't know, maybe there's a chance for him. It's frustrating, maddening even, to see a guy as sharp, as funny, as \"normal\" as he is, describe how painful life can be, and watch him carry that pain so complacently. But I can't be mad at Sam for being in the kind of pain he's in, I can't even blame him for wanting to hurt himself. The fact is, I've only been here a few short weeks. Who am I to say he's being selfish or pessimistic? Through his charm, in a way, Sam throws a wall up around himself, one you feel like you can't tunnel through no matter how \"real\" you are with him. How can you really know him? How can you understand what he's going through, and how can you know what to do to fix it? I like to check off boxes, to feel like I've accomplished something. I like to feel as though I can walk out of a patient's room having made a genuine attempt to contribute to their care. With Sam, it feels impossible to do that. At the end of the day, I am one of a batch of students with stiff, starchy white coats that cycles in and out of this locked unit for six weeks at a time, eager to \"let these patients in,\" but it's likely that nothing will change for Sam and his painful reality in that time. I pursued medical school with an idea. I even wrote about it in my application. I wrote that I wanted to become a doctor so I could meet people from all over, each with a story of their own, and that I could take a little piece of them with me and that all those pieces would add up to something meaningful. I think this became a part of my mindset growing up. My dad was in the military, and he traveled all over the world flying huge carrier airplanes. My siblings and I lived on a military base with my mom, and with each trip we waited for him to bring back all kinds of souvenirs and stories. I started to dream up all the places he went to, and the people who lived there. I kept a picture of a pyramid he took while he was in Egypt on my bedside table. I imagined people with lives so different from mine, and I convinced myself that as a doctor, I would find the most opportunities to encounter all these people, to get to know them and become a part of their stories while they became a part of mine. When I met Sam, I began to wonder if all those pieces I'll take with me would eventually show me how futile this job can feel. It started to feel like so many of the pieces we take are the ones full of pain and hopelessness, frustration and grief, and fear. My short experience with Sam puts a stark but simple realization back into view. I can't fix his life, or hand him some profound new way of dealing with it. And it's not about what feeling of accomplishment I can gain from working with him. All I can do is try my hardest to know where's he coming from. I can educate myself on all the options he might have--medications, therapy, or anything else I can think of. I can help lay them all out for him and try to be prepared to answer any questions he might come up with. I can be honest with him, and I can listen. I can try my best to know what he cares about most, what he fears most. Maybe that's unsatisfying, but I think that's sort of the point. You have to keep trying, whether or not the feeling of self-satisfaction ever comes.

    "data": "By Val Walker Photo Credit:Kellymlacy No matter how busily my mind is chattering away, when I spot a blue heron flying over me, I'm suddenly quiet with wonder. I stop and behold the grace of the bird's wide wings gliding into the wind and my day begins anew--as a beholder of wonder. My love of herons sparks my sense of awe, openness, and reverence, qualities that I've kept private and sacred in watery sanctuaries where herons thrive. Two years ago, I started a book about my awe-inspiring encounters with blue herons and how these majestic birds had helped me heal from trauma and loss. But recently, gazing through my window at maple trees sparkling in a burst of sunshine after a rain shower, I had an epiphany--a moment of awe in its own right. I realized it was my sense of wonder that had kept me going strong all these years, not just those beautiful herons. It was my willingness to be amazed by the beauty of nature, of music, of real-life heroes, ofmanywondrous things that gave me the will to survive and move forward. And here, precisely, is the thought that struck me:It is our ability to be wowed--not only the thing that wows us--that we can claim as a source of strength. Neuroscience has shown us that experiences of wonder are essential to our healing and resilience. Only recently did I realize how much my lifelong capacity for wonder had been so vital to my well-being--indeed, to my survival. No one I'd known had ever validated my experiences of awe and wonder as a sign of strength, wisdom, or even maturity. When I finally recognized howessentialmy ability to be wowed and amazed had been to my recovery as a survivor of trauma and loss, I was eager to encourage fellow survivors to reclaim their sense of wonder. With this discovery about the power of awe and wonder, I delved further into neuroscience research as well as poetry to explore this mysterious aspect of ourselves that allows us to open to entirely new experiences. As Dacher Keltner, author of Awe: The New Science of Everyday Wonder and How It Can Transform Your Life, describes it, \"Awe is the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends your current understanding of the world.\" Exciting bestselling books on awe and wonder have shown how this uplifting topic has given readers a break from the cynicism and pessimism around us, but some stubborn old myths about awe still prevail. Some of these misconceptions can mislead us into high expectations of our moments of awe and wonder that may cause us to miss the smaller, more nuanced surprises. I would like to share two particular myths alongside two realizations about awe that have opened my eyes and made me more humble--in a good way. Myth 1 To gain the benefits of awe and wonder, you need to have a big, powerful, profound experience. For example, you once had a powerful moment of awe at age 23 when you saw a spectacular Aurora Borealis in Alaska. But since then, you have never had that same level of awe later (in real life.) You compare your awe experiences and believe \"nothing compares\" or \"it will never happen like that again.\" Reality Seeking to replicate the same breathtaking awe experience might be causing you to miss out on other moments of awe. Small, brief, and frequent experiences of awe and wonder, over time, offer many benefits to our well-being. We can cultivate opportunities for awe and wonder where we welcome and appreciate the more nuanced moments that still take our breath away. Neuroscience shows how it is thefrequencyof awe moments that matter, no matter how small or brief.Studiesreveal how smaller daily doses of awe and wonder can provide, over time, the greatest benefits to our well-being. Taking an \"awe walk\" in the early morning on a regular basis can give us an opportunity to open to awe-inspiring encounters. Myth 2 You need to be in a calm, clear state of mind to have an experience of awe. Many of us believe that if we are upset, ruminating, worried, or overthinking, then we will not be able to have a moment of awe and wonder. Reality Sudden, unexpected moments oftendohappen to people who are struggling throughgriefand trauma. Surprising experiences of awe quickly switch our focus outward and out of the grip of our self-referential thinking. Ethan Kross, a psychologist at the University of Michigan states in aBBC article,\"When you are in the presence of something vast and indescribable, you feel smaller, and so does your negative chatter.\" Just imagine -- something astonishing captures your attention while you are ruminating or doomscrolling through social media: Your cat jumps into your room, or a chickadee sings at your window, and you stop whatever you're fretting about, snapping out of your thoughts. Somehow, a whole day's worth of worry stops, as if you were \"saved by the bell\" with a moment of awe. Even in a matter of seconds, you're suddenly grateful that there is a wide, wondrous world outside of you to behold. Creating More Awe in Our Lives Creating the time and space for cultivating awe and wonder can become a spiritual practice, or at least a daily ritual of mindful living. For survivors of trauma and loss, we might turn to awe-inspiring poets, artists, and musicians who shared their moments of awe with the world. If there is one survivor of trauma and loss who transformed her life through awe and wonder, I would choose the poet Mary Oliver as my shining example. Her wonder-filled poems have been a lifeline for me and thousands of survivors of trauma and grief. She boldly welcomes awe with a wide, open heart as she marvels at the natural world around her. Mary Oliver proclaims in her poem, \"The Ponds\": \"Still, what I want in my life is to be willing to be dazzled.\" I believe we can find strength through awe and wonder by being open and \"willing to be dazzled\" every day.

    "data": "By Rebecca Fogg It all started so early that I didn't question it-my body yelling that something was terribly wrong with me or my life, even when it wasn't. A chest cramp and wave of chills as a child, when I fibbed to a babysitter about my bedtime and got away with it. Spontaneous sobbing fits so immersive as a teenager that, driving myself to school, I had to pull off the road because I couldn't see. Vigilance in romantic relationships as a young adult, analyzing every moment of tension for a partner's potential indifference or disrespect (which would feel dangerous) as if scanning for cancer. Gut-knotting anxiety in business on the few occasions I met a no-win political situation but felt as though my whole future depended on mastering it. I never spoke to my parents about my youthful somatic suffering, or to close friends later on. Why would you mention that you breathed air, or put one foot in front of the other to walk? If it was in my nature, then nobody could do anything about it. If it wasn't, then it was my problem to solve. I could still experience the thrills of love, joy, learning, helping, and achieving, and frequently did. But they often felt snatched, like luxury items I'd smuggled past a dozing guard who'd awake at any moment and chase after me. Finally, in my early thirties, some especially observant friends nudged me toward therapy, and I learned to recognize and challenge distorted thoughts that caused me pain. Life improved significantly. Then in 2006, my right (dominant) hand was partially amputated in a midnight explosion in my Brooklyn apartment, where I lived alone. Eight tendons, an artery, and the main nerve of the hand were severed, requiring extensive surgical repair at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. Afterward, doctors couldn't tell me how useful my repaired hand would be, because so much could still go wrong in the healing process. Exhausted, disabled, in pain, and mentally muddled by pain medication, I couldn't manage self-care, house care, and a mountain of accident-related paperwork myself; so my family stepped in for a few weeks, then an army of friends took over until the worst was behind me. I was deeply grateful for, and cheered by, the love and assistance I received. But I also felt profoundly lonely, alienated from my self and life, and grief-stricken by unnamable loss. My trauma expressed itself in spontaneous sobbing fits, violent dreams, and intrusive thoughts about the September 11th terrorist attacks (which I'd also survived, as I worked just across the street from Ground Zero). Ultimately, physical recovery required three months out of work, several hundred hours of occupational therapy, and 45 hospital visits that year. I muscled through it by continuing with psychotherapy, speaking regularly to loved ones, and studying the science of trauma and healing, which intrigued and inspired me and gave me a sense of purpose and progress. By the one-year anniversary of the accident, I had returned to the exact same life I'd been living before it and thought I had moved beyond the trauma. I felt (and still feel) changed for the better-closer to loved ones, more empathetic and ambitious for social impact; and the experience brought two new passions into my life: writing and science. My therapist and I decided our work together was finished. Over a decade later, I began writing a book about my injury and recovery, and the science behind it-from the brain's fight-flight program (which enabled me to rescue myself) and the evolution of reconstructive surgery over thousands of years of war; to peripheral nerve regeneration and neuroplasticity, which made my extensively-repaired hand useful again. I titled the bookBeautiful Trauma, to reflect the unexpected coexistence of the wonderful, and the terrible, in my experience. Living alone in 2020-21, as I had been at the time of the accident, I wrote in isolation for hundreds of days while COVID locked down the planet, and the US burned with racial injustice and political corruption. Increasingly, waves of irritation, grief, and despair left me gasping for relief, and I considered this span of time a fresh trauma, symptoms of which would surely abate when the pandemic did. But when they continued to flare occasionally even a year after the last COVID restrictions were lifted, it finally occurred to me that I might still have accident-related trauma to process. So after some time seeking the right practitioner, I recently began a course of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy, which I'd learned about through my book research. The effects so far have been remarkable. The process has surfaced questions I've never contemplated before; and these, in turn, have prompted insights about how old family crises, my accident experience, and my depression/anxiety might be connected-insights that I don't believe I could have arrived at through any other means. Processing these in the safety of the sessions, I've tapped wells of anguish I didn't know I harbored. Outside the sessions I feel an old vigilance relaxing, surrendering intellectual and emotional bandwidth that I hope I can redirect toward accepting what I can't change, and pursuing what will enrich my life and that of others. I know that EMDR won't eradicate stress and sorrow from my life. But based on my experience of it so far, I believe it will help me live with more ease and optimism, as talk therapy did before it. I find it astonishing that I didn't consider pursuing trauma-focused therapy until I'd lived almost 20 years post-accidentandwritten a whole book on trauma. But then, trauma weaves itself into one's full-body experience in subtle ways that can be difficult to recognize, or may only be visible over time as patterns of suffering emerge. I also needed to sit with my new research knowledge for a while before understanding that I could be suffering the effects of trauma despite not meeting the precise clinical criteria for PTSD and that EMDR wasn't just for soldiers. And, I suspect that the way we talk about psychological resilience as a society also plays a role. It's often characterized as a linear, time-bound process; and admired, almost as if it were the product of good character, rather than of innumerable, interacting bio-psycho-social factors, many beyond our knowledge or control. As such, you work hard at recovery, you progressively improve, you finally \"get over\" the trauma-and you're a hero! Who wouldn't want to live that story arc? I needed to believe it in the months following the accident, while I exhausted myself every day, physically and psychologically, grappling with the challenges of my upsetting \"new normal.\" But months later, as I regained health and hand function, and thrived otherwise as well, the powerful narrative may have distracted me from psychological healing yet to do. What is resilience, then, if not getting \"over\" or \"past\" life's most painful experiences? I see it as a life-long process of learning to live with energy and optimism, despite intimate knowledge of our fragility and mortality. It can be grueling work, requiring substantial social and professional support to which I'd wish everyone adequate access. But it offers freedom from the depleting pain of resisting the human condition and the lost opportunity that results from not seeing the facts of our lives as they are. And there can be beauty in it-like the compassion of helpers, the wisdom we gain through coping that we pass on to others, the doors opened to new experiences and relationships to be cherished. Resilience is being alive. In 2008, Rebecca Fogg walked away from her New York life and successful career in financial services to move to London, where she co-founded the Institute of Pre-Hospital Care at London's Air Ambulance and continues to work, write, and learn Scottish fiddle. A graduate of Yale University and The Harvard Business School, she spent five years (2014-2019) researching and writing about healthcare with renowned Harvard Professor Clayton Christensen, author of The Theory of Disruptive Innovation.

    "data": "By Galen Tinder I awoke one morning two weeks away from completing my last year of graduate school, the morning after spending a pleasant Saturday day researching in the library, and it was there. I could tell before I raised my head from the pillow. I didn't know what \"it\" was exactly--some combination of hyper-anxiety and primal dread. When I stood up, the room--a small dorm habitat--wheeled around me ominously, like an out-of-balance carousel trying to spill me onto the ground. I sat back down. When I glanced tentatively at yesterday's newspaper sitting at the foot of my bed, images pulsed and swirled themselves into a chaotic panorama of headlines, photos, and text. I was suddenly aware that my heart was beating fast and loud. Several minutes later, anxiety pushed me out the door into the hallway. It was a Sunday, so few other students were around. I paced up and down the hall, back and forth, passing the day in frightened perambulation. I did the same thing the next day, and the next--it seemed the only way to keep panic from engulfing me. I eked out my last days of school, but despite my effort to act and appear normal, and my evasions of human interaction, my friends caught on that something was amiss and asked what was going on. For the first of many times over the next nearly four decades, I was confronted with one of the isolating curses of severe depression--its inexplicability to the uninitiated. It is so outside the realm of ordinary human experience as to be indescribable. Acute depression is not like being sad in the ways nearly all of us are at times, nor is it like feeling out of sorts. If sadness looks like a harmless gecko, severe depression looms like an all-devouring Tyrannosaurus rex. After four months, the \"it\" left as mysteriously as it had come. I was so relieved that I chalked up the whole ghastly business to an idiopathic anomaly. I moved on with my life, giving it no more thought. But six years later it came back. This time, I was prevailed on by people and circumstances to get medical help. My primary care physician referred me to a local psychiatrist of his acquaintance, one of a number I would consult over the coming decades. It was from this first psychiatrist that I first heard words that, when strung together, went like this: severe clinical, recurrent, treatment resistant, unipolar depression of the anxious (in distinction from enervating) type. Eventually I also heard the term \"endogenous,\" meaning that in my case the depression's etiology was my inner chemistry rather than problematic external circumstances. When my second episode struck, I was several years into my first \"real\" job, meaning the one for which I had been educated and trained. Eventually, I could not keep up with my work and took a couple weeks off to fine-tune my medications--I stopped two and started two others. This episode also ended abruptly after several months. My psychiatrist at the time warned me that a person who has two bouts of clinical depression has a 50% chance or better of further episodes. Sure enough, after the second attack, I had six or seven more episodes over the next 28 years. Most lasted four or five months, limited, perhaps, by my ever-rotating amalgam of medications. During my career with depression, I have taken more medications and combinations of medications than I can remember. I began with SSRIs and later SNRIs like Effexor, atypicals like Wellbutrin, and an MAO inhibitor, Parnate. My current doctor has tested my genes in the hope of identifying chemical matches with particular medications, but in my case, none turned up. I have been hospitalized four times, once for suicidal ideation. People say, in a macabre joke, that a hospital is no fit place for sick people, and this was true for me. Though \"safe,\" I always felt worse institutionalized than at home. Ten years ago, I had electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), to no avail. My inability to describe to others what acute depression feels like has been frustrating and magnified by aloneness. I often saw in the expressions of others their wondering about the characterological weaknesses that underlay my paralysis. I sometimes wondered this myself, and felt shame at being undone by this invisible ailment that was so hard to treat and seemingly impossible to prevent. Today, I can in some measure empathize with people afflicted with auto-immune disorders that are so hard to diagnose and treat and impossible to see. Occasionally people ask me what it feels like to be depressed. I respond that depression, at least for me, doesn't have feelings. It crushes them. I can't, for example, say that depression makes me feel sad or frustrated. Severe depression crushes ordinary human emotions, the ones necessary to our sense of humanity, beneath the fist of terror and despair. It is not even that depression leads to despair. It is itself despair. Desperate for an image, I once suggested to an inquisitive friend that he imagine himself jumping off a ten story building, and landing feet and legs first on the concrete below. I asked him to conjure the agony of his feet and legs fracturing into uncountable shards of bone and shreds of sinew. This is how, I said, my brain hurts. In one of the most eloquent books about depression ever written, the autobiographical Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness, 20th century novelist William Styron brings his literary gifts to a description of his own depression. He calls the term \"depression\" a \"slug\" of a word that has slithered its way into our language to describe a devastating cataclysm. Styron acknowledges the limitations of language to describe an experience incommunicable to those not possessed. He suggests the term \"brainstorm.\" My own meteorological conjuring is an F-5 tornado laying waste a home, a neighborhood, and a town, leaving no signs of life on the horizons. Sometimes called a slim tour-de-force, Styron's book first appeared as a long essay in a 1983 issue of Vanity Fair before it was issued as a book. Soon after it came out, I bought a copy for my wife and in years since have referred people to both the essay, which can be accessed online, and the book. In either rendition, it can be read in a couple hours. Styron writes that \"the pain of severe depression is quite unimaginable to those who have not suffered it, and it kills in many instances because its anguish can no longer be borne.\" I first read this passage 20 years ago, when I was in between episodes. I began to weep because for the first time I knew that there was another human being who knew what I felt like when in the grip. Severe depression scares people and even those closest to it don't know how to help their loved one to feel better. They sense that there is nothing they can say, but out of their own pain and the frustration of helplessness may remark, \"Just hang in there...\"; \"Eventually it will get better...\"; \"Have you tried positive affirmations?\" These efforts at comfort and exhortation at best make me feel misunderstood and more isolated. The distinguished educator Parker Palmer relates that when he was depressed people tried to comfort him with assurance of his eventual recovery. But the person who brought him solace was an old friend who came over every day to massage his feet. Most days, nothing was said between the two men. After my second episode of depression, I began to research the nature, causes, and available treatments. After 30 years, I have kept at it but no longer anticipate making any dramatic discoveries. For decades we have thought that an insufficiency of neurotransmitters causes depression; nowadays we are not so sure. A diminishment of brain chemicals often accompanies depression, but correlation is not causation. In recent research a significant percentage of those helped by the medication they were given turned out to be ingesting a placebo. These days most specialists acknowledge that we don't know what causes depression for a given person, though genetics and early childhood abuse (I qualify for the first, but not the second) can play a role. For decades I got depressed, then got better, got depressed, got better, and so on without gaining any wisdom about my condition or myself. I was convinced I was a case of defective biology and messed up brain chemicals. My worst episode began nine years ago and lasted eleven months. For much of the time I was confined to bed. I came up with a coping mechanism that sounds odd, but kept me alive. Every morning around 11:00am I decided not to kill myself that day. I then immediately reassured myself that tomorrow was another day on which I could choose differently. Then the next morning around 11:00 I made the same decision followed by the same reassurance. In this manner I kept myself alive day by day, for months. Oddly, every morning I would feel girded by Camus' statement that the only serious philosophical question is that of suicide. After seven months, the psychiatrist I was seeing, who was the kindest of them all, told me regretfully that she didn't know what more she could do for me. For some reason, her acknowledgement energized me enough so that I drove home and opened Google. In a few days I turned up the name of a physician who practices what is sometimes called biopsychiatry. This means, in part, that the doctor is skilled in the efficacious mixing of medications and supplements. A cocktail, as it is called. After taking my history the psychiatrist said that while I had gone through a rough time, she was confident that she could help me get better. I was surprised how much her statement lifted my morale. After two months under her care, I recovered. Aside from a minor blip now and again, I have been well for the last eight years. What does this all mean, this episodic career in depression? Perhaps there are two questions here, the first being what does it mean for me, for who I have been and who I am today. The broader question is that of what suffering means for all of us, for those who have walked a far harder road than have I. Is it all meaningless? Does it have a purpose, if not always then sometimes? For most of my life, my episodes of depression, lasting, until the final one, an average of five months, have seemed unrelated to my non-depressed life. They came spontaneously and left the same way, unconnected with life events, my pre and post psychological condition, never caused, so far as I could tell, by emotional stress. So they struck me as biochemical eruptions over which I had no control. They were attacks disembodied from my \"normal\" life. When they left, I resumed this life until the next time. Today I doubt it is so simple. I mentioned earlier that depression crushes feelings like happiness, sadness, empathy, and vulnerability. Recently I have realized that when I emerged from a depression, these emotions stayed crushed. Perhaps I thought I could avoid further misery by not feeling, by retracting into myself, taking my right brain off line, never developing a capacity for authentic self-reflection and vulnerability with myself. Tongue not entirely in cheek, a friend once diagnosed me as suffering from habitual and excessive analyticity. I now think that this quality may have been both a consequence of my depressions and a maladroit defense against more of them in the future. In any event, it has struck me over the last several years that a life of self-retracted feelings has not served me well as either a depression dampener or a way to live. I have gradually taken hold of a different kind of living marked by feelings of sorrow, happiness, regret, reformation, vulnerability, empathy. I don't know how this has happened, but a different way of living has laid firm hold of me and blessed me, at the age of nearly 70, with new vistas of rich experience. Is this in some way a mysterious gift of depression? I would sure like to figure it out, but doubt I will. I was recently trying to characterize to a friend the changes I have experienced and my desire to understand their etiology. When I finally stopped talking, she smiled, cocked her head, and said \"Who would have thunk?\" Perhaps this says enough, at least for now.

We weren't going to make food since there were only five people at home. I now suspect it was also becauseummadidn't wanthalmeonito feel obligated to make anything, especially since the chemo was taking away the energy that had once let her spend days making memujigae-ddeok, my favorite rice cake, which requires sitting in front of a fire in 80-degree weather to make. I didn't think to considerhalmeoni's health, putting my desires before her. I ignoredumma's words and scavenged for food. I walked over to the wooden pantry. Success. A box of Kraft Mac and Cheese. I grabbed it and toldummathis was my dinner. She gave up and told me to do whatever I wanted. Ummaset out a few plates ofban-chanon the table, which was strange because in past years,halmeoniwould cook enough to cover the entire table. I re-read the directions on the box as I cooked the mac and cheese. Dinner felt gloomy. As the last meal I would eat withhalmeoni, the mac and cheese wasn't good. I regretted eating it instead ofhalmeoni'sban-chan, but being a teenager, I wouldn't allow myself to showummaI made a mistake. The last night of the last vacation in Fullerton was uncomfortably quiet. The house had always felt empty oncesamchondecided to move his family away andmaknae-imodidn't sleep over as often. There were no giggles from cousins who couldn't sleep, or songs sung by myhalabeoji. The next morning, I found myself holding back tears as we packed for the airport. Halmeoniwoke up early to make sure we had packed everything. As we put our shoes on, she shoved a package of coffee milk boxes intoumma's purse, reprimanding us for forgetting it. We had bought it at the supermarket days before,halmeonitaking notice of how much I liked it. I gave myhalmeonia last hug, feeling how she was still soft to hold. That was the last time that I touchedhalmeoni, as I couldn't bring myself to touch her while she laid in her casket. Like every summer before,halmeonistood outside and waved as the car pulled out, my eyes wet with tears that I was too ashamed to let out. At the airport,ummaand I poked straws into the six cartons of the coffee milk while in line for the security check. We knew there was no way we were going to throw away the milk and so we chugged it before we made it to the scanner. May 2017 - Albany Airport, NY Ummadecided to miss work for four days to fly to Fullerton.Halmeoniwas no longer on chemotherapy and was forgetting who her children were at times. Appaand I pickedummaup from the airport the day I took the APUSH exam. Only three days later I received a late-night phone call from my cousin, who I have heard cry just once in my life. The three of us returned to the airport at dawn on the 9th, only this time we were all flying to Fullerton. It was the first time we had ever purchased such expensive tickets and paid for the overpriced airport parking fee. Spring 2017-2021 - Experiencing Guilt Every day since May 8th... I have asked myself why I chose to eat the mac and cheese that night. I ask myself when I crave mac and cheese. I ask myself when I see store-mademujigae-ddeok. I ask myself when I askummato make my favorite summer food ofoi-ji,pickled cucumbers and she responds with howhalmeoniwas the only one who could make it how I liked it, and then we fall silent. I have hated my fifteen-year-old self for putting her stupid pride and teenage angst before everyone else. Because of her, I lost my chance to eathalmeoni'sfood one last time. I don't remember the last thing I ate thathalmeonimade. I only remember that I ate the dreadful mac and cheese. I have felt useless. For years, I never knew what type it was nor did I ever ask. Ummatold me that it was simply cancer. That's all I was to know. For years, I've asked myself, why didummanever tell me what it was? I never knew what was happening, what symptoms were present, thathalmeoniwas tired...Ummaand her siblings talked to each other about the appointments in Korean, words that I was unfamiliar with even in English and thus words that I could never understand. Leaving me to ask these questions to myself,ummadecided to depend heavily onunniethe whole time. Unniewas older, smarter, and preparing for medical school, so she was more familiar with the terminology. She helped translate duringhalmeoni's appointments even though she was busy studying for the MCAT. I knew nothing about the human body or cancer. I avoided phone calls, self-conscious about my Korean and fearful of embarrassing myself. I didn't do anything to helphalmeoni. Fall 2018 - Interstate 90, MA While driving home from college in Boston, I finally mustered up the courage to askappawhat the diagnosis was. Liver cancer and... Throughout the conversation, I also realized why I was never included in conversations abouthalmeoni. It wasn't just the cancer, it never is. Myumma's side of the family dealt with many struggles that come with being immigrants and being human. Life was never easy for them, but that was nothing they wanted to make obvious to the children. This is typical within Korean families as we Koreans are very prideful people. The adults in my family have endeavored to allow their children to enjoy blissful, naive childhoods, and to some extent, I feel gratitude towards their efforts. 2019-2021 - Processing Grief My anger towardsummafor not telling me everything abouthalmeonihas long dissipated Even whenhalmeoniwas dying, I focused on myself. I hadn't thought about how myummahad to hear her ownummahad died just days after she had left to go back home to work. That myummahad to spend years living so far away from herummawhile her siblings were always there with her. That myummahad to deal with her daughter being so cruel at a time when she needed support. Only years later have I realized how selfish I was. Since May 8th, 2017, I have come to college in hopes of becoming a doctor. Sometimes as I do homework that mentions metastasis, I wonder if it would've been better ifhalmeonihad lived longer. But would I have felt better after taking heavy science lectures? After reading research papers full of jargon? Would I truly have thought I was doing something to help, or would I have continued to feel useless in this uncontrollable, solution-less situation? I don't know, but I do know that I must forgive my younger self for choosing to eat the mac and cheese that night. As much as I resent her for her decisions, my younger self is still me. She deserves to be forgiven. As a fifteen-year-old, I knew nothing about death, so I didn't know how to process my grief. But on this never-ending path to forgiveness, I have learned that there is no proper way to experience grief. I realized it years afterhalmeonileft before I could show her a better version of myself. And I realized it weeks afterkuhn-imohad ended her own fight with cancer and decided to leave us forhalmeoni. August 2021 - Growing Up I didn't realize it until a few weeks afterkuhn-imopassed, but I didn't hate myself as severely when she died, despite feeling the same frustration towards oncologists and money, or lack thereof. I questioned if it was because I unconsciously likedhalmeonimore and if I was a bad person, but it wasn't that. Guilt hadn't shrouded the grief I felt for her passing. I mournedkuhn-imowithout being overwhelmed with selfish thoughts. I was able to send her off in a more peaceful manner. Of course, I regret being unable to mourn forhalmeoniin a better way, but I believe she would feel proud, knowing that I am trying to make peace with myself.

    "data": "In 2001, when I was 58, I developed odd symptoms in my legs - pain and weakness, falling on the sidewalk and unable to get up without assistance. I first went outpatient to my physician who had no idea what the problem might be. Nervous and living alone in an apartment, I carried my portable phone with me. One evening I fell and couldn't get up. I called 911 and the EMTs from my neighborhood fire station came and transported me to the ER of my Harvard-teaching community hospital in Massachusetts. The physician asked me to get up from the examining table and walk. I told him the problem was not walking, but falling. He found nothing wrong with me and sent me home. A few days later, at home, I fell again. I called 911, got the same EMTs, went to the same ER, was told nothing was wrong and was sent home again. Then I fell a third time. Having the same EMTs for all the three calls, they assured me that this time they would insist I be admitted. I was admitted but to the geripsych unit , as they believed I was making my symptoms up for attention! This scenario is well known in the disability community. If a physician cannot determine a medical cause for reported symptoms, the default position is too often psychiatric. I was placed into a bed and later an orderly told me to get up, as the psychiatrist wanted to interview me. When I told him I couldn't get up, he told me I was lying. After the interview, I asked to see a \"regular\" doctor. She came, had blood work done and later told me the results indicated kidney failure. She put me in the ICU, all the while I kept saying to everyone \"It's my legs\" to no avail. Retrospectively, I know my elevated creatine level indicated not kidney failure but evidence of a rare muscle disorder. After 3 days in the ICU without kidney failure, the team finally decided to listen to me. They did a muscle biopsy and told me I had Polymyositis. I was in a med-surg unit for a few days, commenting each evening to my attending \"This is odd. My feet are paralyzed\". Next evening \"My ankles are paralyzed\", Next day \"My lower legs are paralyzed\". Then I had complete respiratory failure and was in the ICU on mechanical ventilation for four months, not expected to live. A friend told me the medical team was frantic, not knowing what was wrong with me. Eventually, I was discharged to a respiratory rehabilitation hospital as I was still medically unstable. I stayed for a year. I was then discharged to a nursing home on a trach and feeding tube, where I have been living for 13 years. In 2006, I was decannulated after 5 years intubated, to the surprise of many. In 2010 I went for a consult with a Rheumatologist at a Boston teaching hospital where I was made a research patient. After 9 years, I got my correct diagnosis- Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). The team concluded I have GBS based on three factors - my report of what I have since learned is called \"upward progression of paralysis\", the fact that Polymyositis is not a paralyzing disorder, and finally, by looking at the original muscle biopsy slides, where the inflammation of the muscle tissue was insufficient for a diagnosis of Polymyositis. Because of the failure to be properly diagnosed, I never had the opportunity for treatment of GBS in the acute phase. Today, I am in my 14th year as a nursing home resident due to quadriparesis, an inability to not only walk, wash, and dress myself, but also to cook and clean. I can use my hands in spite of the contractures of my fingers, and can brush my teeth, feed myself, turn pages of books, read, write and use a computer. My mind is intact. In 2011, I got a power chair which permits me to go outside when I want, after 9 1/2 years living inside facilities. I'm an accidental nursing home and disability advocate. In 2011, I read an article in the Boston Globe about the possibility of a nursing home bed-hold program being eliminated. This would have put me at risk, after a hospitalization, of losing my \"home\" and having to live in another facility, if my current bed were filled while I was away. I wrote a letter in support of retaining the program to our House Ways and Means committee. The letter was circulated and I was asked to become a state and national nursing home advocate. I am now an active nursing home, disability and elder advocate, nationally published writer, speaker and consultant. You can find some of my work by googling \"Penelope Ann Shaw, PhD\". I am leading an interesting, and hopefully useful, and fun life as a survivor of acute GBS. I enjoy my personal life immensely, mostly my lifelong friends who have supported me in every way during my medical journey.

    "data": "It was quiet that afternoon. Weekday afternoons were always quiet in our house. Dreamy, lazy, languid in the heat of summer, resting on the downstairs couch I heard you calling me from upstairs. Your voice had that same timber, will always have that same timber every time you call me upstairs. I rose, hesitant to leave that sunlit couch, but your voice again Claire, come up just a moment! there again beckoned me up, up into that bathroom. I entered the room and met eyes with you and you said I just need your help for a moment in that hushed way, in that way that made me know it was ME who needed to help you, and it couldn't be Jill. That hushed language between parents and older siblings is one you learn from the moment that second child is born. Out on the smooth counter-top sat Dad's old electric razor. I lifted it, felt it weigh in my hands. I knew what was coming, God we all knew it was coming. It had been coming since April, since that hushed conversation, that same hushed language in the car on a same sunny afternoon, that same don't tell Jill had weighed the same as this razor weighed now. You sat in that chair and stared back at me from the mirror, but your eyes weren't meeting mine, not really, and mine weren't meeting yours, not really. You looked like a child then, like I did when I was five and waiting for Dad to comb my hair, and you looked up at me, your child, in that same way. Waiting for me to comb your hair. The razor felt heavier now, the weight of that hush felt heavier now, everything was heavier now the moment you looked up at me like that. I turned the razor on. It became real then. I fumbled my way through the already thinning patches of your scalp. I felt unsure, unready, wielding that razor. Shouldn't I know how to do this, shouldn't everyone know from the movies? They do this all the time in movies, this moment right here. But they don't tell you about how heavy that razor is in movies, they don't tell you how much steel can weigh when you look at me like that. You made a joke like you always do - that Irish bleak humor never turns off, not even for a second. I laughed. I appreciated it. You could tell how hard this was, I could tell how hard this was, but we just kept staring and not seeing, not actually. But we knew, and we kept that secret, you and me, between ourselves and the hushes and that heavy, heavy razor. I finished and cleared some stray hairs from your crown, and you sat (admiring yourself, I liked to imagine). Seeing yourself, that terrifying feeling of seeing yourself, and while you were seeing yourself so was I. I was seeing you, actually. For the first time, maybe. You were thinner now, medications already starting to wear on you. But you looked determined. But you looked scared. But you looked at me and I knew you were looking at me as equal now, because I was seeing you for the first time. How is it that after sixteen years I am only now seeing you for the first time? We'll be okay you said. That 'we'. The 'we' that meant we were in this together, as partners, as equals, that 'we' that made up that hushed language, that 'we' that had been weighing down on me since you pulled over that car on that sunny afternoon in April and you told me that you had breast cancer. Yes, that same 'we' that made me know we--you, and me, and Jill--we would all be okay. Claire Stauffer is a senior at Boston College, where she is double majoring in Biology and English.

    "data": "What makes up the world, for me, is language. While the natural sciences contend that the world is made of matter--atoms, molecules, cells, genes, tissue, organs--I believe that language accounts for what happens between people. We don't just pass down genes. We inherit the words we speak. We don't just care for our own bodies. We care for our own stories. I arrived at Boston College certain that I would study English and love it, but after a year of introductory English classes, I felt entirely uninspired. What was the matter? When it came to the stories, what mattered? During sophomore year, something happened in my own story. I stumbled across a news article about a new interdisciplinary Medical Humanities minor. Medical humanities is a field devoted to the humanistic and cultural study of medicine, caregiving, illness, disability, and representations of the body; it values the interconnectedness and complexity of these issues, looking at them from different perspectives in order to better understand them. These topics have always been present in my life: my sister works in a lab, my twin is studying medical imaging, my mother is an EMG technician, my parents cared for aging and ill relatives and friends. Could medical humanities synthesize my love for literature and my interest in caregiving and healthcare? Sophomore fall, I attended a symposium at Boston College on Genetics, Narrative, and Identity. Contributors to The Story Within, a collection of essays on genetic diseases and the complex life-stories and decisions surrounding them, captivated me with their candor, strength, and insight. The day culminated in a writing workshop and keynote address given by Rita Charon, M.D., Ph.D., who founded the field of narrative medicine. She made clear to me what it means to be present for another person, in sickness or in health. I decided to enroll in an introductory medical humanities course. In the texts we studied and the conversations in which we engaged, the complexity and high stakes of the issues--genetic testing, public health, representing disability and disease--marveled me. The most compelling text to me was Elaine Scarry's The Body in Pain. She writes: \"Whatever pain achieves, it achieves in part through its unsharability, and it ensures this unsharability through its resistance to language.\" 1 Pain is that which cannot be put into words, cannot be represented; so specific, so individual, it falls outside of any system of communication. At the same time, pain is perhaps the most difficult thing for a listener to believe. If pain really did destroy language, dissolve the relationship between two people, what did this mean for me and my world of words? But, more importantly, pain calls us to bridge the gap between individuals. Pain calls us to create something, to listen with empathy, to trust, to acknowledge the other, to bear witness. In sickness and in health, in pain and in pleasure, our words and our stories are what humanize us and connect us. A friend of mine recently shared with me that she has been dealing with diabetes since she was two years old. She is one of the most driven, most involved students I know. I felt so fortunate and honored to hear her story and her insight. Her story and the conversations that followed strengthened our friendship. In college, the stories of chronic illness or disability are so often untold and unheard. Built environments and institutional policies, sometimes established without consideration for those who have chronic illnesses or disabilities, can intensify these potentially isolating experiences. Laurie Edwards, a writing instructor at Northeastern University and a person with chronic illnesses herself, writes on the state of colleges for students with chronic illnesses or disabilities, shedding light onto the ways in which colleges fail these students.2 Students, faculty, and administrators should acknowledge these students and their individual needs. Making accommodations for these students and respecting their stories for these students will ensure that higher education remains accessible to all people--sick or well, disabled or able-bodied. On a college campus, it is easy to assume that everyone is healthy, with crowds at the gyms and a vibrant and energetic student population. At the same time, illness is easily normalized. What college student hasn't been exhausted? Who hasn't caught a cold in a residence hall? We must heed narrative medicine's call to honor the stories of health and illness in each individual, to acknowledge its specificity, and to listen with care and empathy. With this kind of attitude, we can perhaps see that the campus of the healthy and the campus of the ill are not different places: they're the same. Over the coming months, I will facilitate the sharing of stories about college students living with chronic illnesses or disability. Stay tuned for future features from me on these issues.

    "data": "That red brick fireplace, its ledge was strong but not that comfortable. Cold in the summer, warm when there was a roaring fire. It was the perfect spot to get close to her when she was sitting in her chair, I could hold her hand. It was our confessional, our little corner of the world where we could talk, where nobody else existed. Grandmother and granddaughter. My mom, a nurse and my dad, a dentist, would occasionally break into our bubble, to hand her a dixie cup filled with milk and another cup with chemo pills. In these moments, as a fifteen year old, I started to think about a healing profession and how nursing would allow me to help people. But we had projects, my grandmother and I! We sewed, read the paper, ate stale junior mints and just existed. Her hands were always busy folding laundry, saying the rosary, crocheting for hours on end. The world existed around her, and she was the center of our hearts. Metastatic Breast Cancer, diagnosed in the month of October. Columbus Day to be exact. Wow! How has it been 26 years since that day? Oh how I still hate the anticipation of that month. The summer had disappeared over the horizon and the winter chill set in during those first few months of her diagnosis. The big C, the diagnosis, the day, so vivid in my mind, we were told she had 6 months to live. It felt like she was taken away already but only for a brief moment. Can you catch cancer? Could I hug her? Could I love her the same? Why was I so afraid? All the things that a 15 year old conjures up, staring cancer in its ugly face for the first time. My very devoted and religious, Polish grandmother, Kathryn Piotrowicz, went on to live well with terminal cancer for 10 years after her diagnosis. Living independently in Philadelphia when she could and then back with our family when she became sicker. It was a gift in so many ways but it was extraordinarily hard on my mother, who was her primary caregiver while also managing a multi-generational household. It was emotionally tough. July 21st, 1995 The day was a scorcher, 3 H's, hazy, hot and humid. One of those nights when the evening cooling wouldn't make its way to the morning. Coming from Boston with my baby sister, driving as fast as I could to my family's home. I passed Exit 6 on 95, it is imprinted in my memory forever. This is when I stopped crying for about 5 seconds to realize maybe our Babci Kathryn wouldn't wait for us. The lessons learned from caring for the sick provide us humility. They also hopefully help us to focus with intention to live a life with no regrets. But I have carried one regret around with me since her death. I wish I had known. I wish I had known that it was ok to get close to someone when they were dying, that they could hear everything you were saying to them. That hot July night that our Babci died, we made it to her. Opening the back door to the house, it was normally full of life, but it was so distinctly quiet. I followed 10 feet of oxygen tubing on the ground that led me to my childhood bed that had been moved downstairs for her. I knelt by her side, she was tucked in with her sleeping cap on and she looked so small. I was so afraid of the silence, the darkness, the aloneness. I left her side not knowing how to talk to her, what to say. They say hearing is the last to go. To this day, I still regret that I didn't stay longer by her side to tell her how much I loved her, how proud I was of her and what an incredible gift she was to our family. Her imprint on our lives would be forever. She passed away 15 minutes after my sister I had arrived from Boston, that hot, hot July night. I have to believe all these years later, that her story is part of my story. She was a teacher, heaven sent with all the lessons I was to take from her to become a compassionate nurse. To understand the complexities of ethnicity, poverty, perseverance and most importantly love. My grandmother struggled. Her husband passed away when she was 50 and she went on to raise 2 children with limited financial means, yet she moved forward. Despite people's differences, you can always use love as a thread. As a nurse and nurse practitioner for almost 21 years, her experience has helped me tremendously with every patient interaction. Her story has helped me stay centered and to always remember there is a person behind a diagnosis or long term illness. April 30th, 2020, it was the height of the pandemic. It was my Dad's birthday. The skyline of Beacon Hill, the gold dome on the state house glimmering in the distance. Coming from infusion on Yawkey 8, I hurried down the stairwell onto Yawkey 7E, to return to clinic. All of our patients were worried about the virus, never mind a cancer diagnosis. Pre-pandemic, the halls would have been buzzing with energy, patients waiting to check in, sometimes music playing, maybe even a painter giving patients painting lessons. Now, it was eerily quiet, no noise, no conversation. Almost like a holiday, but it wasn't \" I need to call dad later to wish him a happy birthday,\" I thought to myself. I heard my phone ding, a text message from my college roommate and dear friend, Annalisa. I call her Al. Her mom had been living with metastatic ovarian cancer for over 5 years. \"Carol is not doing well,\" she wrote. \"I need to talk with you. I need your advice.\" Annalisa is not an alarmist in any way and had been doing a beautiful job of managing all things medical for her mom. She is deferential and private and really never asks for help unless it is important. My heart sank. Not now, not during this pandemic. A year prior, I had convinced Carol to get a second opinion and to consider one more line of treatment, an oral chemotherapy medication, and she had done incredibly well with very little in terms of side-effects, until now. Carol was a go getter, a busy lady, up early, late to bed with a smattering of things she did everyday. With faith as her central anchor, she was living her best life during her cancer diagnosis, she learned to redefine her life after her beloved Roger passed away 10 years ago. I was almost shocked to hear all of a sudden she was in trouble. Why now? As healthcare professionals, we are often asked our opinions. What would you do, how would you manage this? April 30th, 2020, I did not want to give an opinion. Not during a time when the medical world was making decisions around a surge of Covid cases, a virus that we didn't understand, space availability, patients passing away without loved ones by their side. Professionally, I knew that Carol needed to come into the hospital to deal with her symptoms or she may pass away quickly. Dizziness, weakness, shortness of breath. I suspected hyponatremia and potentially a pleural effusion or fluid in the lung. Progression is what I feared, but I also knew Carol had been crystal clear that God was in charge, her worries were always placed in her God box. The oral chemotherapy was her last treatment option. I wrestled with my mind, it was a tug of war. Do I keep her at home and just let it go the way it is going to go, or do I tell her to come into the hospital to manage her symptoms and maybe get a little more comfort and a little more time with her family, to prepare. But we were in the midst of a pandemic. I wanted to be there for Annalisa, for Carol, to do the right thing, but my mind was clouded with emotion, because I love them. I told Annalisa to bring her in. I waited, I waited, I was so nervous. I had the proverbial pit in my stomach, my thoughts were racing. I was asking my dearest friend to drive her mom to a hospital that was admitting Covid patients by the dozens. What if this was the wrong decision, what if she passed away this admission? What if she died alone, away from her daughter and son who were her everything? I was grappling with my own guilt around being protected from COVID facing care due to my youngest child's health issues, while many close NP colleagues were standing up an outpatient Covid unit. I knew I needed to step up to the plate and help Annalisa, to help Carol. Maybe this was where I was supposed to be. I held on to my faith. They finally arrived to the front entrance of the Yawkey building. They looked so worried, those stupid masks made it all so unfair, it felt so transactional. That we couldn't interact in our normal way, a hug, a conversation. Instead Annalisa was handing over her Mom, it felt deeply wrong. Humor is sometimes our only defense in tense situations. We had a quick laugh. They were late because Carol had forgotten her forbidden stash of communion her priest gave her. It is sacrilegious to have communion in your pocketbook, but we chuckled under our breath. Only Carol. She needed it, to know she was protected. The communion would provide her with solace. In every way, it felt so reassuring. There was no decision to own. Carol wanted to be admitted. She wanted more life despite her failing body. Her faith was intact and we would be ok. She looked weak, she was tired, she was scared but still the strong woman I knew. I came back to reality. Yes, it was 5:30 pm and still April 30th. Dad's birthday. Carol would be discharged with hospice within 48 hours to her home of more than 30 years. Days turned into weeks and then months. She was determined to make it to her 82nd birthday in July. It didn't seem like an impossibility. She was strong and the hospitalization allowed her the pause to reset the clock Now she was in-charge of the time she had remaining. We would spend the next 10 weeks learning about love, about faith. Annalisa and I were blessed with daughters late in life. Our girls, 10 and 11 have always loved each other because of our life long bond. The four of us - my daughter and I, Annalisa and her daughter-- would be there on most Fridays visiting. Carol loved it, we did too. Annalisa with her fancy ice coffee in hand on the front stoop of Carol's house, the girls riding their bikes to a little park, their own little space of happiness. Annalisa and I talked with Carol about her worry around death, about what things felt important to her, about her deceased husband. We just talked like we always did. There was so much peace in these weeks, it was like it was our own little confessional away from Covid, away from the big C. The weeks were filled with normal summer activities, planting flowers, eating fruit, and the girls had their favorite junk food, ice cream, cupcakes, you name it. There were lots of hovering feelings about not being at the Covid bedside as a nurse, lots of regret and guilt much of the spring and summer. But in this little part of the world, I helped one family. Carol would venture out of her house, everyday to sit in a beach chair, while people came in droves. Covid or no-Covid, her lifelong friends could not be stopped. Lined down the street daily, with a honk, a wave or a quick gesture of love. There was beauty transitioning to hospice, to have time for reflection with those that you love. Carol passed away a little bit after her 82 birthday this past July 2020. She taught me so much in her final months. She helped me spiritually. You know, she was Polish. I go back to the seat on the brick fireplace as a young teenager. I go back to the night my grandmother passed away, to the words I did not say. I didn't know how she was feeling when she was facing death. Was she scared? We didn't talk about the legacy she hoped to leave behind. I often think of the countless families I have worked with as a nurse over the past 21 years. Being able to share knowledge, compassion and provide advocacy makes my own regret dissipate. For Carol and my dear friend Annalisa, I knew what I needed to do. To ensure that Carol did not suffer, that Annalisa was left with the tools and knowledge to help Carol with a peaceful death. Annalisa and her brother Paul were incredible advocates for her and I know they will never live with regrets. They were God-sent.",

    "data": "September 1990 In her dream, there was an intruder in the house, a frightening presence. She found herself sliding close to the wall as she tried to become invisible, to find a way to escape. Outside, she saw a group of people standing on the lawn. Her husband was there, her children, as well as friends and colleagues. Several policemen arrived. An officer stepped out of his car with a bullhorn yelling: \"Betsy - Betsy! Stay in front of the window so we can see you! Then when we shoot we won't hit you!\" I pour myself a cup of tea, musing about the dream and the feelings it evoked. I am struck by the way my psyche is working to sort things out. Breast cancer. Ever since that moment of diagnosis, that jumble of terror and grief, my mind has alternated between dead slow and hyper-speed. The mammogram, biopsy, partial mastectomy - events that ripped through my orderly life - only numbed me further to this trauma. Yet this dream had sent a message directly related to my dilemma: should I agree to undergo radiation treatment? As a psychotherapist, I believe in the unconscious. I guess I have to trust its wisdom in putting these images together. I must get going, for I have to go back to the hospital. As I head up the stairs to change, I experience again that strange sense that has haunted me throughout this time: a sense of profound loss and fear coupled with a feeling of incomprehensible reality. Every day in my office, I hear so many people speak of how difficult it is to take in the enormity of their troubles. I marvel at their stamina, their dignity, their bravery. But I cannot relate it to myself facing breast cancer, for I feel so out of control, so abnormal. My life seems to be passing by me in a series of jolts. It is so difficult to express my feelings, for I am topsy-turvy. I can see my home, my daily tasks, my work, my family. Yet I am separated from all that by the image of a neon sign constantly flashing in my head: I have cancer I have cancer I have cancer. I see a woman walking toward me on the street, and I want to scream out to her, to ask if she has it too. Or I want to blame her for not having it. I look so normal - but nothing is normal, whatever that means. Scary things tend to happen in rooms that have no windows. Lying on the hard treatment table in the radiation suite I await the \"marking up,\" the tattooing around my breast that will guide the beam of radiation. Those dots will be mine for life. I stare up at the inane poster of a cute kitten pasted on the ceiling. Technicians move around me with what look like slide rules and triangles in their hands. I am the challenge, they have the formula. While I recline, awaiting their solutions, I distance myself and see this experience as a movie scene: semi-nude woman, one arm carelessly thrown up over her head, harsh bright lights all around. Is this really happening? The staff is kind but impersonal. I envy them their distance from this disease even as I feel isolated by their detachment. They photograph me; I feel like a tumor. Then they tattoo dark blue ink dots in a large rectangle around my left breast - the guide for daily treatment, for 33 times. I worry - my heart is under there. Before leaving the hospital, I have to meet with the doctor who will be in charge of my treatment. I must sign a release form forgiving them if the treatment causes me irrevocable harm, such as a fatal tumor, or heart damage. And of course, I have to expect to be burned from radiation. Is this really necessary? Can I trust that the treatment won't put me at further risk for more breast cancer? I feel so cynical about it all and then, suddenly so angry I can hardly contain myself. Rationally I sort of understand all this, but I am no longer rational. Somehow I switch into coping, clench my teeth, sign the form, and leave. Exiting the garage, I am asked if I am a patient. I am not a patient! So they charge me the visitor amount - nine dollars for my one-hour visit. I am enraged and drive blindly out to the street. I am driving now, back on the same road, still in the same day, heading to my office. But I am not the same. I have a patient to meet in an hour, and I am just going to make it. I feel enormously strained in my heart. Where can I put breast cancer for 50 minutes? I must look so changed; I must radiate fear and anger like a thundercloud. But when I walk into my office I am complimented on my dress... and I open the cancer file in my head and put my experience inside. I turn myself over to my patients' pain. What a relief. I can do this. This is the day after Thanksgiving - and the first day of radiation treatment. Am I thankful? I try to put it into perspective; as people have said to me I am lucky; it could have been worse. This will not be as bad as having a mastectomy. That is true...but am I lucky? Another underground hospital garage, dank and cold. Down, down I drive, watching the clock and worrying I will not be able to find a space. Is that enough of an excuse for not showing up? I find my way to another radiation site in this huge hospital. A nurse leads me to a closet-like changing room. \"Everything off from the waist up, dear\" she instructs. I am trembling as I hang my clothes in the steel locker. Later, I cannot find the right locker. As I emerge into the waiting room I surreptitiously scan it. There are eleven people here, all in white hospital gowns like me: they have cancer. There are men, women, and a teenage boy - he has no hair under his Bruins cap. In a wheelchair in the corner, her head wrapped in a scarf, sits a pale young woman, a basin in her lap. No one looks at each other; they simply wait. My shield of denial is crumbling, for the reality of why I am here can no longer be denied. I want to bolt out the door, out of this place of cancer. I do not want membership in this club! I feel devastated, alone in my fear and pain. And I know I must repeat this scenario for six and one-half more weeks. Again I am driving home, the same road, the same day. A replay flashes through my mind: the treatment room, the enormous radiation machine, the technicians leaving the room while I am radiated, the hum of the machine, a mobile of hamburgers swinging over the table. The hamburgers are to distract the children they treat, who are harder to manage when they are frightened. I am the model of cooperation - I want them to shoot straight. On the kitchen calendar at home, beside the date, is the number 33. Each day it will go down; as I cross it out it seems more hopeful, one less treatment to go. I call my husband and tell him what the experience was like. It does not feel like me talking to him, for I am in a faraway place. I have this unreal sense again, for to talk with him about what to have for dinner seems so insignificant. Do we still do dinner? Am I still me? What is it I have lost? It is what I have gained that has caused the feelings of profound loss: a new identity. I have a disease. I am a cancer patient. I belong to that club, the cancer club. My normal life is gone. As I set the table for dinner I trim the tulips I bought earlier. As they are squeaked into their vase, they are still the same. That gives me pause. I take the salmon out of the refrigerator - how many times have I set this table, cooked salmon for dinner? Through the gain of cancer I have lost normal, for living my life, work, and daily tasks at the same time as I endure treatment for breast cancer isn't normal. Reflecting on this feeling, I see my life now as two parallel tracks: on the left, the usual track of a day, breakfast, work, dinner with my family; on the right, the unusual track - the letters that spell C A N C E R. That image, in all its starkness, captures the feeling. I focus on it as I place the fish in the pan, then have to pause, because the image is changing. Some tiny connections are materializing between those two tracks, some small everyday predictable links that may start to ease this whole ordeal for me. One of these is happening right now - as I'm making dinner for my husband. It's salmon. Salmon is normal.

    "data": "By Steve Buechler For most of my adult life, my identity was rooted in my role as a professional sociologist. In that capacity, I taught graduate and undergraduate courses on social theory, social inequality, social movements, and sex and gender. I also published seven books on women's movements, social movement theory, and critical sociology. All that came to an abrupt halt at age 64 when a routine physical exam led to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, widely considered the deadliest of the blood cancers. Without immediate treatment for AML, life expectancy is measured in days or weeks, months if you're lucky. So within 48 hours, I went from feeling perfectly fine to intensive chemotherapy and a five week hospital stay. This initial treatment achieved a temporary remission that bought me time to decide upon further treatment for a disease that always comes back. Three months later I received a double umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant, followed by six months of gradual and uneven recovery. Nothing about it was easy, but I hit the treatment trifecta: early remission, full donor engraftment, and no graft-versus-host disease. This led my oncologist to call me a \"statistical outlier,\" but it was her sweet words that stuck with me as she pronounced \"this is as good as it gets.\" I'm now more than six years out from my transplant, cancer-free, and considered cured. I was too busy with cancer to develop a retirement plan. But I have found a calling as a peer volunteer, patient advocate, and writing workshop instructor in the cancer community. This work is meant to honor those who saved me. For most of my life, doctors didn't take me seriously because I didn't have anything serious to treat. Sprained ankles and sore throats were pretty mundane. Leukemia was different, and the medical care I received was simply superb. My doctors and nurses combined skill and expertise with compassion and empathy in ways I will never forget or could ever repay. I would never call cancer a \"gift\" or an \"opportunity.\" But if surviving cancer doesn't change you in some foundational way, then you really weren't paying attention. The coping skills I developed throughout treatment continue to serve me well in many aspects of my life, and my odyssey has left me with profound gratitude, deep empathy, renewed resilience, and a rich appreciation for the simple pleasures of life.

    "data": "My younger brother, Simon, will always be my best friend. He was born with a mitochondrial disease and was never able to speak or walk, yet he exuded kindness through his unique and loving personality. Simon's gratitude radiated during each of his days, no matter how tough. He often needed nebulizer treatments and suctioning to aid his breathing, but he flashed us huge grins despite the discomfort of the mask and tube, as if we were all in on the same joke. He truly loved and appreciated the things that many of us take for granted, like taking long naps, getting off the bus after a day spent at his special education school, going to music class, and spending a sunny afternoon sitting outside. He especially loved spending his birthday with family, friends, and colorful balloons tied to his wheelchair. I will always remember the huge smile he had whenever he caught a glimpse of the Perry the Platypus balloon I gave him for his twelfth birthday, which somehow remained inflated for months. Several months after his twelfth birthday, Simon's respiratory problems became severe. We learned that he likely had less than six months to live. This news was difficult for me to handle as a sixteen-year-old, but my parents and friends offered immense support. My best friend often escorted me out of the classroom when I needed to cry, and my mom frequently picked me up early from school and took me to our favorite coffee shop. In November, Simon began a hospice program and continued to enjoy each day through massage therapy, music, his teachers and caregivers, and our family. On March 26th, less than three weeks after Simon's thirteenth birthday, I received the call from my parents that I had been dreading. They told me that they raced home after an urgent call from his caregiver. He was having more trouble breathing than they had ever seen, and they weren't sure how much time we had left with him. Since he had survived many rough days in the past, I clung to the hope that when I got home he would still be smiling at his orange thirteenth birthday balloons. My mom stopped me at the door on my way inside the house. She told me Simon had passed away a few minutes prior. My vision blurred and I dropped my backpack. I ran into my parents' room where Simon lay, still believing that he would be okay. Once I physically reached his body and could no longer hope for another day with him, it felt like my whole life shattered. I hugged him, crying, and wondered how we would continue on without our favorite ray of sunshine. While losing Simon was unbelievably traumatic and devastating, it motivated me to spend time with other children and adults with special needs. Two summers after Simon's passing, I worked as an assistant teacher at his special education school and as a respite caregiver for people of all ages with disabilities. I am grateful to have had the ongoing opportunity to work with individuals with exceptional needs and to teach and learn from them. My experiences with Simon and other members of the special needs community with whom I connected have inspired me to work toward a career in medicine. I plan to dedicate my life to offering care and love to children with disabilities. Isabel is a junior at Vanderbilt University majoring in Medicine, Health, and Society.

    "data": "I want to tell you a story. It took place during the radiation phase of my breast cancer treatments. My radiation sessions were scheduled at the same time, every day, for six weeks. Each day I saw the same patients and the same technicians. We were all on a first name basis. I saw the same hot chocolate-cappuccino-coffee machine, the same cheap plastic bowl of fresh apples, oranges and bananas, the same stack of well-worn out-of-date magazines, the same relatives and friends accompanying their loved ones, and the same zapping of radiation. The one thing that didn't stay the same was our changing bodies. We were all deteriorating. Not only was my body changing from the radiation but also the deep chemically-induced menopause I was in, was severely affecting my quality of life. If you can imagine how regular menopause affects women who lose their hormones gradually over a period of years, just think how it felt to lose mine in two weeks. I was having extreme hot flashes every ten minutes, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, some so harsh they left me faint. Menopause can also create a depressed feeling and I felt that creeping in as well. My doctor told me that losing my hormones so fast due to chemotherapy was doing such a job on my body, it was like driving my car into a brick wall at forty miles an hour. I found his analogy validating because that's exactly how it felt. Smash! Bang! Boom! Just to let you know, radiation in itself is actually quite painless. Unfortunately, what happens as time wears on is the skin that's been radiated gets burned. Sometimes it looks like a fashionable tan, sometimes it looks like a sunburn, and sometimes the skin gets so badly burned, the doctors have no option but to stop the treatments completely. That's exactly what happened to my friend Lily. Lily and I met in the radiation waiting room while she was being treated for breast cancer. She was of Asian decent, and even though she stumbled with her broken English, and I with my Chinese, we understood each other perfectly. Just like schoolgirls, we saved seats for each other every day. We connected on many levels and as the weeks moved along, we developed a deep love and respect for each other. One day Lily confided in me that she would no longer be coming for treatment. She opened up her shirt and I couldn't believe my eyes. The severity of the burns on her chest was shocking. I didn't know if Lily's skin was more sensitive than mine or her level of radiation stronger. What I did know was that Lily's chest couldn't tolerate any more and her treatments were stopped permanently. I felt terrible for the hopelessness of her situation and, selfishly, I also felt terrible for myself -- I would miss her. I made several attempts to stay in touch, but sadly Lily and I never saw each other again. That's not the story I want to tell you. Another patient I met while sitting in the waiting room, day after day, was Peter. He had prostate cancer and we soon became buddies. Peter's treatments were affecting his hormone levels, similar in ways to mine. He was going through a male menopause of sorts, complete with hot flashes, weight gain, frequent bouts of crying, periods of insomnia, low libido and an overall lack of well-being. He often shared his emotional and physiological changes with me in great detail because he knew I would understand. Peter and I developed quite a bond, playing pranks on each other regularly. Each afternoon, while waiting for his name to be called, he ate a banana from the fruit bowl. Peter just loved bananas. One day, he was late for his treatment and I noticed that there was only one banana left in the bowl. I didn't want anyone to grab it, so being the thoughtful prankster that I am, I snatched up that Chiquita and hid it in my pocket. When Peter finally arrived, he ran over to the fruit bowl but alas -- no banana. His disappointment was palpable. \"What's wrong Peter?\" I asked. \"You look so sad.\" \"I wanted a banana but there's none left,\" he answered. \"Awww...that's too bad. Well, look down here. Oh my goodness. Is this a banana in my pocket or am I just happy to see ya?\" Quickly I whipped out that banana and Peter's face lit up. What a sight. To most people, this may have seemed like such a small thing, but those kinds of exchanges amused us to no end and it helped get us through the day. That's not the story I want to tell you. We all had our own routines when it came to our radiation appointments. This was mine: I'd sign in, walk into one of five closet-like changing rooms located within arms reach of the patient's waiting room, put on one of those terribly revealing hospital gowns and leave my clothes on the hook, praying that no one would steal them. Of course, I really didn't have to worry too much about that. Being 5 feet tall, my pants would look like knickers on anyone else. After that, I'd sit in the waiting room, have a cappuccino, chat with a friend, read a gossip magazine to get up-to-date with the really important issues in life, and wait for my name to be called. When I'd hear 'Marla Lukofsky' over the speaker, I'd be escorted into a cold room with a large radiation machine and would hoist myself up onto an even colder metal table. Then I'd slide the hospital gown down to my waist, lie there and watch the huge high-tech contraption move across the ceiling until its projected grid pattern aligned itself with the tattoos on my chest. The machine would then zoom in close, and the technician-of-the-day would run out of the room as fast as he or she could, and hide behind a five-inch-thick Plexiglas-sealed container. That got me to thinking, 'Hey, if it's that dangerous for them, then what am I still doing in here?' \"Are you ready, Marla?\" the voice on the intercom would ask. \"Yes, I am.\" \"Okay, then. You can keep breathing, but DON'T MOVE.\" Talk about a contradiction. Then the radiation machine would let out a disturbing sound that alternated between a high-pitched squealing noise and a machine gun popping. In a minute or two it would be all over, only to be repeated several more times on other areas of my chest. Sounds pretty simple doesn't it. They'd do their job by zapping me and I'd do mine by lying still and taking in the rays. Each day was becoming harder than the next. I started to feel like I had nothing important to do. In order to bring in some money and keep myself somewhat active and stimulated, I got myself a part-time job at the only place that would hire me, Tusquellas' Fresh Fish Market. Can you imagine feeling nauseous and choosing to work in a FRESH FISH MARKET? What was I thinking? Talk about upsetting aromas!!! On the plus side, when I went into a huge hot flash, I'd just leave the customer in the middle of their order and jump into the walk-in freezer at the back to cool off. Sometimes I'd come out with icicles hanging off my hair. I'm not kidding. Every day like clockwork, while my spirits were plummeting, I'd leave work and go to my radiation sessions. The technicians would always ask me, \"How are ya doing, Marla,\" before we'd get started and no matter what I'd answer, they'd never say much back except for the expected platitudes. I hate platitudes. On a regular basis I would challenge them. \"Don't be so guarded with me or any of the other patients. We're not going to hurt you, you know!\" I guess I made an impact because when I received my Certificate of Completion from the Comprehensive Cancer Center, there was a hand-written inscription on it saying, 'Don't be so guarded! All the best! Andrew and Judy.' That's not the story I want to tell you either. One day, while sitting on the cold slab in the radiation chamber, Andrew, my technician-du-jour, asked me how I was doing. Maybe he was expecting me to say the usual 'I'm fine thanks and you?' but I didn't -- not that day. \"To be quite honest Andrew, I'm awful. I work in a fish market, I smell like Tilapia, and I feel like I don't have a purpose in my life anymore.\" Then I started to cry and cry and kept crying as if I was making up for all the days that I hadn't let myself cry. Andrew handed me a Kleenex and gently said, \"Marla, I think youdohave a purpose. Maybe you just can't see it right now.\" \"What are you talking about Andrew? All I do is come in here every day stinking of fish, get zapped, glow in the dark and go home. Nothing more than that.\" \"Well, I'll tell you what I see, Marla. The other day we had a new patient. Remember? She came in with her husband, the one with the blue scarf on her head. Well, as you know, we have to take a Polaroid picture of each new patient for our records, so that we can make sure we're giving the right radiation to the right person. Anyway, you and Peter were sitting together, chatting away as per usual. Then we came into the waiting room to take that woman's picture, but she refused to let us and started to cry. 'No, you can't take my picture. I'm ugly. I look terrible and I feel terrible, and I don't want anyone to see me like this. No! You can't take my picture.' We explained to her that we couldn't start her treatments until we had the Polaroid, regulations, you know. Her husband tried to change her mind and another technician tried too, but she wouldn't budge. So, we left the room to re-think our strategy while she sat there still crying. Then I saw you, Marla. You walked over to her, knelt down right in front of her, put your hands on her knees and said, 'Hi, my name's Marla. I couldn't help but hear what you said about the picture, and the way you look. I really understand some of what you feel -- not all of it, because I'm not you, but I have to tell you something. Underneath my scarf, I look just like you.' And Marla, you took off your red bandana and exposed your bald head to that woman, a total stranger. Then you said, 'You see? I look just like you. And you know what else? I think you're beautiful, and trust me, I know a beautiful woman when I see one andyou...arebeautiful. I wish I had your looks. I let them take my picture and I'm nowhere near as beautiful as you. Now, if you don't let them take your picture, then you won't be able to start your radiation and the sooner you start it, the sooner it'll be all over and you'll start feeling better again.' Well, Marla, the woman sat there for a minute, thought about what you said and blurted out, 'OK... I'll let you take my picture.' As soon as she said that, we scrambled back in, snapped the shot, and got her into the radiation room. Her husband was grateful and so were we. And now you come in here and tell me that you don't have a purpose? Well, all I can say is that what you did for that woman was a wonderful thing. You helped her get through a difficult time. What's more important than that? I saw you take that banana for Peter and make him laugh. I saw you get that hot chocolate for Cheryl and get her to open up to you. Even though you feel terrible right now, you have to remind yourself that you help people...in more ways than you realize and, in my books, that's having a purpose -- a very important purpose.\" I was shocked by what Andrew had told me. I was more shocked by his total recall. \"How the hell did you know about that Andrew?\" I asked. \"Do you have hidden cameras everywhere?\" \"Actually, yes, we do, in every room, with intercom systems. We watch and listen to everything that goes on around here.\" \"Geez...if I knew that, I would've put on some lipstick.\" After Andrew left the room, I sat there absorbing all that he had said. He made me feel better. He gave me a new perspective on things. You see...he took the time for me, to point out that I took the time for someone else. It was only one moment out of our lives, one moment in time, but it gave so much and sometimes that's all it takes to help each other get through to the next day and the day after that. Sometimes, it's just that simple. That's the story I want to tell you. Previously published in the International Journal of User-Driven Healthcare and Cell2Soul.

    "data": "When people look at my poster, their most frequent response is, \"Wow! How can I get my own records? I have always wanted to have mine!\" I tell them, \"Just do it! And be persistent. Even if the contents turn out to be upsetting, I doubt you will ever be sorry.\" This is the story behind how I finally received mine and what I did with them. I had been wishing to get my hospital records for a very long time. I felt deeply that they belonged to me as they were words written about me during a hellish three-year period in my adolescence. I was certain that they would be filled with outrageous statements, and I desperately wanted to read and respond to them someday. I was finally released from the last hospital in 1963, and it wasn't until 1978 that I began my search in earnest. During the intervening years, I had been finishing college, marrying, and raising four young children. Although I managed to keep all of those hospital experiences safely compartmentalized away so I could raise my children with warmth and kindness, believe me, the retrieval of my records was never far from the surface. In early 1978, shortly after meeting my fantastic fellow comrades (Judi Chamberlin, Dan Fisher and David Oaks), I was inspired to start by politely writing to the directors of each of the four different hospitals where I had been locked up: Baldpate Hospital in MA, The Menninger Clinic in KS, Massachusetts Mental Health Center in MA, and Westborough State Hospital in MA. Weeks went by, and I heard nothing. I wrote again. I waited. Again, I got no response. I even considered flying to Topeka, Kansas, to storm that psychiatric barricade and demand my records in person. Since I was then a single parent with four young children and dwindling finances, I calmed myself and talked it all over with my trusted and dear therapist, Lee. He had saved my life back in 1963 when, by chance, I first met him the night before I was sent to Westborough. He was a young resident and the only person during those three years who had looked me in the eye and smiled and was genuinely kind. He gave me hope. He told me there was nothing the matter with me that had not been caused by the abuses in the hospitals: combined insulin/ECT without anesthesia, seclusion, restraints, molestation, masses of Thorazine, etc. After meeting with Lee from time to time over the years, in 1978, after my failed letter-writing campaign, we planned a new record-seeking strategy. He wrote to all four hospital directors. It was difficult for me to give the power over to him, but he seemed to be my last, best hope. In 1975, he had become the Commissioner of Mental Health in MA so he clearly had the power, which I was sadly lacking, and he generously used it to help me. Because of his status and powerful stationery, he heard back from everyone except Baldpate. Some of them were only a few pages of summaries, which was annoying, but when he received them he gave them to me. Finally, during the spring of 1978, since Baldpate had ignored him, Lee made an appointment for us to drive out there. He told them he wanted us to read the records together, and, since he had been the commissioner, I am sure they felt forced to let us come. I had been talking for months about wanting to steal my records so, on the drive out, I showed Lee that I had brought a briefcase and explained that I had every intention of stealing the pages. I wasn't sure how I would manage it, but I knew I could figure it out once there. I still remember the day as if it were yesterday. It was a bright blue, sunny day, the trees and flowers were in full bloom, and I was feeling full of hope and confidence. When we arrived at this desolate location in the country an hour outside of Boston, it was a time-travel experience for me. I had not been there since 1961, and the big red \"farmhouse\" still remained, looming over the grounds. We were ushered into a small office, far from the desolate cinder-block unit where I had been subjected to the combined insulin/ECT. There were two chairs and a little table between us where the thick folder with my records sat--my huge and seemingly glowing hidden treasure! We were at first left alone together to read them, and we decided that I should start reading and then pass each page to Lee. Soon, however, every few minutes an official would nervously interrupt us by opening the door and asking if we wanted more coffee. The records were filled with atrocious, labeling and demeaning words about me, even more disgusting than I had ever anticipated. And, with growing intensity, I wanted to steal every single page from that house of horrors and report the atrocities all over the world. Finally, after more than two hours of reading, Lee and I had a conversation about how hard they were making it for me to actually commit my theft. He said he wanted to go to the bathroom and told me to feel completely free to do whatever I wished with the papers while he was out of the room. What an advocate he was! But, at that moment I was overcome by his genuine generosity and kindness and fully aware that he might get into serious trouble if I were to steal the entire record. I simply didn't feel I could put him at risk, so when he returned from the bathroom I explained that I had slipped every other page into my briefcase. I paid special attention to picking the most egregious ones, making sure to leave enough bulk so they would not notice, and they didn't. We drove back to Boston. I was elated, and Lee was the good sport and true advocate that he had been for so long. I spent many hours and weeks and months reading the pages over and over, trying to make sense of every notation, every diagnosis. Finally, I bought a box, decorated it with flowered paper, arranged the pages neatly inside, and tied it up with a pale blue satin ribbon. I kept it on the top shelf of my bedroom closet, where it stayed for years--until October 11, 1991! That was the date that Anita Hill was called to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in reference to the appointment of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. She claimed he had made unwelcome sexually provocative comments to her when they worked together at the Department of Education and the EEOC. I believed her! Anita was treated dismissively and poorly by the senators, and her treatment put me into high action. I went to my closet, took down my hospital records and proceeded to go through every single page with a fine-tooth comb. The next day, I took the pages and copied them all several times. I then cut out the pertinent, disgusting and demeaning comments and assembled them all on a huge poster board, which I had laid out on my bed. I designed it using the typed comments, photos from my childhood, and several small sections from op-ed stories I had written which had been published in newspapers. It took several days of moving the pieces around until I felt completely satisfied. I then shopped around and found a great radical union press, which was willing to print 1,000 copies, way back before digital. The folks at Red Sun Press in Jamaica Plain, MA, were wonderful! I felt respected, they took my poster seriously, and I was thrilled! I then began showing, selling and giving it away at conferences. A dear and close fellow comrade bought the first twenty copies in a true gesture of solidarity and generosity. It was finally registered with the U.S. Copyright Office on April 25, 2007. I mailed one to The Museum of Modern Art in New York City as someone had once told me that they keep all art which is given to them. I sent a letter of explanation, asking them to consider having a show of art by people who had been locked up in mental institutions, and they acknowledged receiving it. A framed copy hangs in the history exhibit at SAMHSA. I gave one to my internal medicine doctor who just recently told me that it hangs on the back of her office door. She is now a dean at Harvard Medical School so perhaps it is having a positive influence on future doctors there. Two years ago, I had three large fabric, plastic-laminated copies made for using at marches and demonstrations. One of them now hangs in the office of Digital Eyes Film. In the end, this poster has given me a great deal of satisfaction. I feel it is my personal megaphone from the top of the Empire State Building, shouting out to the world: THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME and THIS MUST STOP!!! Dorothy Dundas was institutionalized for three years as an adolescent in the 1960s and was labeled a \"schizophrenic\" and forced to undergo 40 combined insulin coma/electroshock \"treatments.\" She experienced and witnessed many atrocities. She believes that luck, determination, her own anger and one compassionate advocate were her best friends on the road to her ultimate survival and freedom. Through a number of op-ed pieces in The Boston Globe, Miami Herald and Detroit Free Press, she has voiced her opposition to abusive psychiatric practices. This poster, Behind Locked Doors, which she created from her hospital records, has been used in training programs. Dorothy lives in the Boston area where she has raised four wonderful children. She has recently retired from The Crystal Lake Express - her own safe, friendly and reliable car service in which she was the sole driver for 30 years. Dorothy is also a blogger on Mad in America: Finding Resilience and Hope in the Face of Despair.",

    "data": "Each fall at Boston College, theWomen's CenterhostsLove Your Body Week(LYBW), \"a week of programming dedicated to promoting healthy body image on campus.\" The Women's Center, in collaboration with other organizations, aims to give students space to reflect on their relationships with their bodies. Inclusivity is a key feature of this week, as many of the events of consider how body image intersects with race, gender, sexuality, ability, and class. This year events ranged from lectures on body image and the media and panel discussions on colorism, to a performance of Eve Ensler'sGood BodyandEmbodied Expression, a therapeutic painting session. The week kicked off on Monday, November 9 with the opening reception forEmbodied Stories, a photography exhibit byBen Flythe, a student photographer. Flythe photographed students and their bodily identifiers--tattoos, scars, burns, skin color, and birthmarks, for example. Accompanying the portraits were quotations from interviews with the students, who discussed what their bodies mean to them. Although the portraits highlight the specificities of each body, the students never becomejust bodies: their identities shine through; the photographs celebrate the dynamic and complex ways identities align with body image. In his gallery talk, Flythe emphasized the diversity of the stories he captured. These individual stories, he noted, speak to our own stories of embodiment. We each have an embodied story, and putting our own stories into dialogue with the stories of others--those portraits, for instance--is to understand that we are all connected. This year I was fortunate enough to have a small hand in LYBW, as I helped to bring two student speakers to the opening reception. Leading up to the event, Marwa Eltahir--a Women's Center staffer and co-coordinator of LYBW--and I sat down with Erin Sutton and Justin Kresevic and heard their stories; we were struck by how their stories spoke to the goals of LYBW and the complexity of body image. My work with Health Story Collaborative prepared me well for this task, and I adapted theHealing Story Sessionguidelines and questions for the purposes of the event. What's more important, however, is that Health Story Collaborative taught me how to listen, to be present as someone shares their story, to accompany them. What mattered most was letting them tell their stories that needed to be told. At the reception toEmbodied Stories, Erin told her story of living with bulimia and her difficult, continuing journey to recovery. She spoke to the difficulty of coming to love her body at Boston College, where body image and appearance issues so often go unnoticed, unsaid. She expressed her gratitude to the people who have supported her, and spoke to the daily challenges she faces in coming to love her own body. Justin spoke to the difficulty of being short, when masculinity is associated with being tall and muscular. This dissonance has affected his personal relationships, and he works everyday to accept his own body. Justin emphasized the need to work against the problematic ideals of men's body images: masculinity is as individual as each of our bodies. Erin and Justin challenged all of us in attendance to understand truly what Love Your Body Week means. Loving one's body isn't something to be taken for granted, to be considered easy. When so many images and ideals of bodily perfection and worth hold up problematic and impossible standards, coming to love one's body is a challenging and harrowing experience. By sharing their own stories of embodiment and acknowledging their continuing journey towards loving their bodies, Erin and Justin asked us all to consider our own stories. I am so grateful to have been a small part of LYBW and to have heard these stories. Erin's and Justin's stories, along with the stories of students photographed by Ben, speak to how important it is to talk about these issues and how valuable it is to enter into meaningful conversation with others. These stories have stayed with me, in my own process of coming to terms with my own body. Sharing stories, at the end of the day, is about building community, starting conversations, and realizing that none of us are alone, that our stories all matter. I look forward to hearing more stories, perhaps telling my own, and continuing the worthwhile conversations around body image happening both at Boston College and beyond campus. Erin ended her talk with a powerful statement about our selves, our bodies, and our stories: We are all worth it.",

    "data": "By Beth Fornier In 2015, when I was 26 years old, I moved out of my childhood home in Somerset, Massachusetts with my then boyfriend, Rob, and took a job as a guidance counselor. My mom encouraged me to live at home a little longer, but, at the time, I really wanted to have an apartment. Rob and I had looked at places together, and found one that we agreed was great. I felt excited. Looking back, it wasn't a good idea. I still called my mom every day. I had followed in my mom's footsteps by becoming an educator. One day, I called my mom after an especially hard day at work. She said, \"Hi, what's up?\" And, I said, \"thank you.\" She said, \"For what?\" I thanked her for giving me a good childhood, an education, and making sure that I had everything that I needed. I had the kind of childhood where we stay outside playing with friends in the neighborhood until the streetlights came on. I always had plenty of food and clothes, and even a $5 weekly allowance. Just normal and happy. In my work, I realized that not everyone had the kind of childhood that I had. I loved my work and was proud of it. I had roughly 240 students and met with each of them two or three times a year, or more, depending on their needs. I was super organized, color coding all my files for my new students: freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. I made sure that they all had all of the credits they needed to graduate, and that they were doing well at home. If they were not, sometimes I needed to call the Department of Children and Families. I also taught guidance lessons for each grade, which I loved doing. I was a good orator and I did my best to make sure that the students understood the material. Many students came to see me, even if they were not my students. I had been warned about one student named Brenna, and was told that she would never talk to me, that she didn't talk to any faculty or staff. In our first meeting, we were just sizing each other up. I remember her having a small smirk on her face and mischief in her eyes. I could practically hear the gears turning in her head: \"How can I make this woman's life miserable this year?\" I just smiled back and introduced myself. And here the game started. I met with her regularly to establish a rapport. She was always tardy and would come in late with a Dunkin Donuts cup. Before long, she started to call me Beth. I would roll my eyes and say, \"Miss Fournier.\" She would say, \"Okay, Beth.\" One day, her Mom said to me, I don't know what you do when you talk to my daughter, but she wants to be a guidance counselor now because of you. I was so happy and surprised. I couldn't believe it! I miss her a lot. I don't know if she ever became a guidance counselor, because my career was cut short soon after, but I am getting ahead of myself. My boyfriend Rob and I had been dating since 2009. We met at a camp where we were both counselors. We were married on April 18, 2015. Rob and I went to Ireland for our honeymoon. We had a fabulous time and it gave us a chance to relax and unwind after the work involved with planning our wedding. We stayed at a renovated castle that had been turned into a hotel. It was very cool, just outside of Dublin. We took several bus trips, including to Northern Ireland to see the Giants' Causeway. It's an amazing place with all of these hexagonal stones that were formed by lava, and there is a legend that it was built by two giants. It was really strange, but also the most beautiful place that I've ever been. We also saw the King's Road from Game of Thrones which has these big rows of twisted and bent trees. It felt so magical to be there. I was in awe, like I had been transported back in time. One of the highlights of the trip was the many discussions we had about the future. We both wanted to have children but not right away as we wanted to travel. We talked about trips we wanted to take and even names for our future children. We were excited to start our life together. It was sunny and mild all week. When Rob got a cold, I attributed it to his tendency to touch all kinds of buttons in public--elevator buttons, and crosswalk buttons, which he didn't even have to touch. I kept telling him to wash his hands or use Purell after button pushing, but he wouldn't. Then one day I got the same cold. I developed a cough that didn't respond to over-the-counter medication. Rob started to feel much better, but I did not. When we returned home, I still had the lingering cough, but I wasn't that concerned. I called my doctor, and she prescribed a low dose of Prednisone. One night I had a new symptom: a pain in my neck. The next morning it had spread to my back. I thought I must have pulled a muscle moving boxes to our new apartment. I was getting ready for work, so I set out my clothes for the day. I figured a hot shower would help, but it didn't. Then I tried to take a Prednisone pill and I couldn't swallow it. At that point, I panicked and ran to Rob to tell him. As I spoke, my arms went numb. I thought it would pass, so I told Rob I was going to work. He said, \"No, you're going to the hospital.\" He was very supportive, and he did not want me to drive myself. I still didn't think it was a big deal. I thought that when I got to the hospital, they would tell me what was wrong, give me some kind of treatment and I could get back to work. In the ER, I described my symptoms: My body felt really strange; everything seemed to hurt. I felt like I was going to pass out and felt extremely hot. My symptoms and anxiety level continued to increase. Eventually, after a lot of tests one of the doctors said, \"I'm sorry. I think I know what this is. It's called Guillain-Barre Syndrome, or GBS.\" I felt as if I had pitched forward into darkness. By three o'clock that afternoon, I couldn't breathe on my own, and I was placed on a ventilator. At that point, I think it was worse for Rob and my family seeing what was happening than it was for me. I sort of blacked out. I was 26 years old and fighting for my life. I was then put in a medically induced coma for 7 weeks as they tried to stabilize me. The next thing I remember I was at Spaulding Cambridge and was hearing my mother's voice reading my favorite Harry Potter book to me but I was unable to move or speak. At one point, I woke up, still heavily medicated, and looked at her. I shook my head. My mother said, \"Do you want me to stop reading?\" and I nodded my head, \"yes.\" That was the first time I was able to communicate. I was still unable to speak due to the ventilator. This was a very hard time for me. Communication was difficult but I always felt my mom's presence and this was a gift to me. I couldn't talk with the trach, but finally they said we could try leak speech. Leak speech is what they called it when they deflated the tracheotomy balloon enough that I could talk through the \"leak.\" I was so freaking relieved! Just to be able to talk for short periods! I never realized before this how frustrating it is not to be understood. After many weeks, I was finally able to lift my head on my own. Everyone was in tears. I felt overwhelmed by the emotional reaction. My mom never left my side. Sometime in July our wedding proofs came in. Rob said we had to pick out the pictures for our wedding album. I tried, but they looked too blurry even with my glasses. I told Rob and my mom to describe each picture, and we would decide whether to include it in the album. One picture was of me and my best friend, Emma. I wore a big Disney princess dress with a sweetheart neckline, the kind I never thought I would wear. Instead of a veil, I wore a pretty headband that matched my dress perfectly. Emma was one of my maids of honor, along with my sister. Since I had arrived at Spaulding Cambridge, I had been having hallucinations. One night, I called Rob because I thought the nurses had left me in the parking lot of the CVS near our house. Another time, I was upset because I thought the nurses were putting my pillows into a pool that was in my room. Finally, one night I couldn't see, just total darkness. Finally, they sent me to Mass General where they performed an MRI which showed that my central nervous system was under attack. Mom said that the MRI images showed that my brain and spinal cord were lit up like a Christmas tree. It seemed that my optic nerve was impacted the most. They sent me to Mass Eye and Ear where a doctor told me I was blind. I couldn't understand what he was saying...He said it so matter of fact, like he was telling me I had a cavity, but it meant my whole life would change. I kept thinking, \"How can all this be happening to me? I am only 26 years old!\" Asking \"Why me?\" was useless, as the doctors really had no answers. They ended up calling it \"GBS Plus Plus,\" which made no sense to me at all. Plus what? Eventually, the doctors told me that they think what I really had was ADEM, Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Unfortunately, this diagnosis came too late to do anything to reverse the condition. Due to the acquired brain injury from the second attach, I couldn't remember how to spell things, and I couldn't count to ten. I could only count to about three and couldn't think what came after that. It made me frustrated so I stopped trying. I would just tell them, \"I'm sorry, I can't do it.\" I couldn't tell you the date I was born. But I can tell you that my best friend, Emma, was an integral part of my healing. Emma came to every hospital that I was in. After about a month, they transferred me to Spaulding Charlestown, where I stayed for 6 weeks. They don't let you stay very long. There was a big meeting with all of my therapists, Rob, and my parents. They determined that they couldn't do anything further for me, so they took out my trach and my feeding tube and sent me home. I said, \"But I can't walk yet!\" I didn't really understand that I was permanently paralyzed because when they had first told me about it, I was still medicated and couldn't take it in, even though they thought I understood. No one answered me. I felt the room go silent. Rob was adamant about keeping me home and taking care of me. So, he found an apartment building with an elevator and we moved in. I felt very lucky to have him. One time, we were listening to our favorite band, Matt & Kim, and I wanted to dance. He unbuckled me from the chair and lifted me up. He put me on his feet and held me and we danced. Rob hired PCAs to take care of me when he was at work, and we got along with them really well. We would hang out, laugh, play games. I felt happy. I thought, OK, we can do this. One year after our marriage, we celebrated our anniversary by having our baker recreate the top tier of our wedding cake. At one point, Rob asked me if it would be OK if he enrolled in an improv class. He was asking because of the cost. I said, sure, that was fine. I wanted him to have a life outside of taking care of me. I didn't know that he had asked his mom to hang out with me every Saturday, which she did. I think he had a taste of freedom. He also asked my mom to stay with me every Sunday. She said no, because she felt like he needed to spend one day with his wife. He was really angry at her. I had no idea. Rob did not want to hire a PCA for the nighttime, even though I kept begging him to. I didn't like to wake him up if I needed something at night because I knew he had to work in the morning. If I did wake him up to ask him for water, he would give me the water, but he would keep saying, \"Are you done yet? Are you done yet?\" So, I felt like I had to stop drinking and was not getting enough water at all. One time, at the hospital, they said they could not do my Rituximab infusion because I was so dehydrated. They had to give me a ton of fluids. Rob was angry with the nurse. He kept yelling at the nurse, saying, \"I can take care of her.\" They were getting ready to call security on him. I felt nervous, like, \"Who is this angry guy?\" I didn't know what was going to happen. At one point, after that, Rob asked me, \"Do you think I'm doing OK?\" I said, \"Of course!\" But, that was a bold faced lie. That's when everything seemed to change. One day my friend Amy asked me if everything was Ok between me and Rob. I said, \"Yes, why?\" She said, \"because he is not wearing his wedding ring.\" When I confronted him, he said, \"Who told you?\" I was so angry-- like he thought I would never find out just because I was blind. But, I did, because I have good friends. I was really pissed off. I asked him to set up an appointment for counseling. He said he would but he never did. One day, out of the blue, he said, \"I'm thinking about leaving you.\" I was so shocked. I felt like I had been punched in the gut and had the wind knocked out of me. I felt my heart sink like when you look down from the top of a roller coaster. I asked him why, but he just repeated that he was thinking about leaving me. He couldn't give me an honest answer. I found out through my lawyer that Rob had filed for divorce without my knowledge. I kept losing things. I lost my job. I had lost my sight. I lost my ability to move. I lost my husband. I thought I did everything right to have a good future, but I felt like a failure. I had the whole picture of our lives in my head--good jobs, a house, a dog, kids. I wanted Rob to be a good man and stay with me, but he wouldn't, and I realized I couldn't force him to. At this point, my mom was already making arrangements to bring me home, because she knew he was going to leave me. She and my dad had a ramp and an accessible bathroom added to their house. The study on the first floor was the only place that would work for my bedroom so they set that up for me. I was there for four years. For months, I was so depressed I wanted to die. I didn't want to be in a wheelchair the rest of my life. I cursed God and the doctors for saving me. Then Covid happened. One of my PCA's was infected and spread it to my whole family. I spent 42 days in the hospital. I was terrified and didn't want to die. Gradually, I recovered, but I had no place to go. I could not stay in the hospital any longer; they needed my bed. I couldn't go home, since my family was sick, too. My dad, who also spent time in the hospital, had long Covid. I went to one nursing home for a week and then came to The Boston Home (TBH), where I was greeted by Kristy Ford. I was super scared. I had no idea how I got here. I thought that I would be going home once my parents got well. I didn't understand that this wasn't temporary. I was really angry and grieving, sobbing and crying. I felt completely lost. I didn't know who was feeding me, touching me, or anything. It was a terrifying experience. I couldn't believe I was in a nursing home at age 32. I had a meeting with Christine Reilly, the CEO, because I was having a difficult transition. She told me that if I wanted to stay, I needed to make some changes. That's when I learned how to recognize the staff by the sound of their voices. I was always good at names and faces, but without sight I had to figure out what to do. I had to rally real fast. Once I learned the flow here, I began to attach names to the voices of the residents, too, which helped me to make friends faster. It was Kristy who invited me to Writing Group, where I started to write prose and poetry. It was a therapeutic experience. I finally had several poems published this year by Origami Poems Project. I was over the moon! Then I started painting. I entered my first TBH Art Show in September, 2022, where I sold my first painting. I had heard about The Art Show the previous year, and knew I wanted to be part of it, but when I first asked about joining the watercolor class, they weren't sure how to make it happen. Then a student from Lesley University, named Madeline, who was doing an internship at The Boston Home started helping me paint one-on-one. When her internship finished, I began painting with Maddy Hoy, who had joined the activities staff. Because I was not always blind, I can envision the scenes and colors in my mind's eye, and then Maddy mixes the paint colors I describe--like Luna Moth Green or Indigo Blue. I still dream in color. Together with Maddy, we determined that my left arm is better for painting, even though I was right handed. Maddy will help me to position my hand by telling me if I need to move my brush closer to the canvas or to the left or right. The first painting I sold was called Sunrise Sunset. I was ecstatic and ready to keep painting. I have sold several paintings since. I dictate my poems. The first one I wrote was called Floating Head. I wanted to describe how it felt to not feel half my body. I felt like a ghost. I wanted to get that message across. Now Christine Reilly uses Floating Head in her staff trainings! I would never be a published writer or an accomplished artist if I had not been here. The creative arts at TBH saved my life and helped me to blossom. I realized that being in a wheelchair is not that bad because I can still achieve more, and I am surrounded by people in the same situation, who understand. It is not lost on me that the book my mom read to me when I was in a coma was Harry Potter, \"the boy who lived.\" I may not be a wizard like him, but I am Beth Fournier, the girl who lived.",

    "data": "By James Kraus I've been blessed with excellent, energetic health. As a kid, my parents named me \"the explosion on legs.\" Although lacking competitive tenacity, I participated in many sports and outdoorsy activities. Most recently, working out regularly, yoga, dance classes, and most enduring of all, bicycling. I rarely get colds, don't think I've had the flu or Covid. Friends and medical professionals were surprised I've never been on medications or hospitalized. I still have my tonsils. I don't have any allergies. I brag I've never thrown up. At sixty-two, my work was physical: handy man/construction work, large gallery deinstallation/installation, moving/transporting fine art and furniture. I'd often bicycle nearly an hour to jobs with a 30-40lb backpack of tools. Mid-March 2023, I passed a full physical with flying colors. March-April, 2023, I worked 8-12 hours seven-days a week. After which, I was beat. I relaxed and slept like crazy, but never recovered. Friday, May 5, 2023, while riding my bike to Boston College for my weekly radio show, I couldn't catch my breath on slight inclines and coasting downhill. Near BC, I confronted the Beacon Street hill paralleling the Boston Marathon landmark, Heartbreak Hill. I couldn't go on. I managed to walk my bike up the hill and star the show just in time. My voice was faint, raspy. I told listeners about my adventure. Folks posted their concerns. I aired appreciation and terror. During the show, I scheduled a doctor's appointment that afternoon. Pedaling to his office, my breathing was worse. A nurse said my vitals were perfect. A young nurse practitioner ordered an EKG - also perfect. I said I feared cancer. This situation was like nothing I'd experienced. Cancer I knew. Both my parents succumbed to the disease. The NP listed a slew of other possibilities: heart, lungs, thyroid, but ended saying, \"When we get older, our organs don't function like they used to. This could just be a case of getting old.\" I fired off bewildered indignation. How could I go from extreme physical activity and two-weeks later this may be my life. He replied, \"It very well could be.\" Monday morning, a nurse called. Severe anemia. Over the next ten-days, my condition worsened. My third floor apartment was near impossible to reach without breaks. I slept far too much. I became spindly, shaky. White-outs were common. A morning call to my doctor brought orders, \"Get a ride to an ER, soon.\" At Beth Israel by noon, I was admitted immediately. Stuck, poked, hooked to sensors and an IV drip, the doctor probed a gloved finger and held it to my face - a dark residue indicated digested blood in my stool. I said it's cancer. She said she suspected internal bleeding from an ulceration or esophageal tear. Easily fixed. At my age, a common diagnosis. Again, the age thing! Around midnight, I was transported to the GI unit. Being a life-long loner, a truly single man, the beeping equipment, bright lights, smells, yelling, my roomie's 24/7 blaring TV, constant required interruptions and tests were overwhelming. Sustained only on that delightful, salty, citrus colon evacuating beverage I needed to drink every 15 minutes. I got no sleep. In the morning, I met the wonderful Dr. \"Bird\" who introduced himself with an adorable lie, \"I'm looking for Mr. Kraus?\" \"That's me, doc.\" \"You sure? I'm looking for a 62 year old anemic man. I'd say you look 45 and in good health.\" \"That's so not true but I'll take it.\" Dr. \"Bird\" echoed the ER diagnosis; a bleeding ulcer or tear. Again, I said I suspected cancer. He, like my nurses, implored me not to get ahead of myself. \"You're in excellent health and spirit. It's likely minor. You'll be home in a few days.\" Two-and-a-half days passed. My bowels never ran clear. Likely a GI tract lined with dried blood. Regardless, a colonoscopy and endoscopy were performed. Later that day, Dr. Bird returned. \"Ya' look a little dower doc. What's up?\" \"You were right. You have cancer.\" \"No? Really?\" \"The endoscopy found an extremely large, oozing, bleeding esophageal mass.\" Instantly, time ground to a crawl. Although in a fog, every sense and detail felt ultra-vivid. I couldn't fix on any point. Cross-legged on my bed, I rubbed my thighs, rocked back and forth, blurting out a barrage of a lifetime's questionable, suspect, indulgent behaviors. Dr. \"Bird\" tenderly suggested avoiding such questions. \"No one knows how or why you got cancer.\" A CT scan would answer what extent and stage. Dr. \"Bird\" left me with sage words, \"I know it's shocking but excellent health masked your illness and excellent health will help you fight this. Also, James, it's now your time. This is the time for absolute honesty. Stay positive. It's as powerful as medicine.\" Once alone, I cried intensely fueled by fear, guilt, shame and regret. Projections of my parent's treatments and (perhaps my own) ugly demises played in my mind. I lamented and rued what was, what may have been and what may never be again. I halted my three-hour pity party choosing to earnestly meditate. I hadn't done it in days. Deep breaths summoned the universe's guidance. The answer. What about those twelve steps that brought nearly 10.5 years of sobriety? Could they help navigate this new disease that indisputably wants me dead? Step 1: I have cancer. That won't change. I must manage this new life, treatments, appointments, emotions, who I tell, their reactions. Although powerless over cancer, I had true power in my choices for coping and care. Step 2: I must trust in life's generous forces, a power beyond me, to let go of self-will, keep sane, serene, and believe I'm cared for. Step 3: I turned my will and life over to g_d's care. I vowed not to play Google doctor. Trust the process. Like \"Southie\" AA old-timers say, \"Yuh right whaya' otta' to be, kid.\" Step 4: I must release and resolve resentments against cancer, doctors, the medical field that missed this, fate and, hardest of all, myself for allowing this to happen. Chastising myself or other's faults helps no one. Grab a feather not a bat. Step 11: Through prayer and meditation, improve our conscious contact with God. I recalled in 1981 my father gave me a book while grappling with late-stage Leukemia. Rabbi Harold Kushner'sWhen Bad Things Happen to Good People. In 1939, my young father and grandfather fled Nazi occupied Prague. All family that stayed perished. A highly respected genius engineer but a troubled and depressed atheist, my father was regularly lauded as a good honest man. Why did g_d give him cancer while evil people thrive? For that matter, why me? I found a YouTube video of Kushner speaking in 1984. He said g_d doesn't play games or push buttons, selecting who's stricken by illness. G_d does't test people or give them \"only what they can handle.\" Nature's laws don't recognize good or bad. A rock fell from a mountain and hit me. It doesn't wait to fall and strike the deserving. This is \"unquestionable biology.\" NOT g_d's plan or punishment. Kushner assured g_d isn't a genie, slot machine or ATM granting wishes, dispensing jackpot miracles. He declared, \"Don't pray for miracles. They won't come. But pray for strength and faith and watch miracles happen.\" Step 12: It's said in AA, application of the first eleven steps brings a spiritual awakening. After walking my diagnosis through the steps, I believe I had another spiritual awakening. I had tools, coping skills. Even a committed loner like me isn't in this alone. I vowed to strive for positivity. Ask for help. Express sincere interest in those along side me. Hear their stories. If asked, share my story. Stay upbeat. Laugh often. Continue being humorous, trusting, pray, meditate -believe. I had a plan: Don't default into self-pity or obsesses over myself and situation. Accept the staggering vulnerability, my neediness and the challenge of admitting my condition to others. My fear of being seen as a vicim, sick and dying. For two days, I felt upbeat, buoyant. Dr. \"Bird\" arrived with my CT scan results. I anticipated good news. I couldn't have been more wrong. Stage IV esophageal cancer. Highly metastatic in my liver, affecting several lymph nodes and innumerable tiny nodules on my lungs. I was gone. Unmoored. A million miles from shore. Lost at sea. Tears rained down. I asked Dr. \"Bird\" to see the scan, situated backward on a chair - shins on the seat, arms propped on the back, rocking in a weird genuflection. I peered at the computer monitor. We took a frightening, ugly voyage through my gut. For two days, leading to my release, nothing distracted me from looming death as palpable, pervasive and deeply rooted as my cancer. A friend drove me home, and stayed while I ate yummy fish tacos. It eased my re-entry disorientation. Once alone, my home of nearly 40 year was bittersweet relief, familiar yet alien. I weirdly missed the hospital and nurses - my doting angels. Days later, I answered an indelible call from a devoutly spiritual friend, Stella. I shared my diagnosis. To my surprise she revealed her husband had bladder cancer and was responding well to two-years of treatment. \"James! You in the light and spirit. I'm gonna pray hard but I don't think the universe is done with you. Uh, uh. You've gotta lot more to give to this world.\" June 8th, my home drive friend overcame unease, we met my oncologist, Dr. B. We totally clicked. A practicing, spiritual Jew, our belief in prayer, faith, and humor synced. I adored our witty meandering banter that seamlessly switched to professional communication about the \"mass\" (\"It's gross, right? I don't like it.\"), relating details (\"It's incurable. Remission is miracle status. But, I've seen miracles happen.\"), the chemo and immunotherapy potions and unfathomable regimen. (Every two-weeks. Two hour in-clinic immunotherapy, then forty-six hour home chemotherapy infusions - until July.) I requested my prognosis, \"I'm not sure I want to say. I could have five doctors here, with different opinions.\" My mother exceeded her three month prognosis by fifteen years so I pressed for the number. \"Three years. The last year will be hell.\" She urged, recoveries are unique as fingerprints, a positive mindset and gathering prayers are good as medicine. \"When you're back on the bike, you send me a picture.\" The encouragement and support from her, my friends, the steps, my plan, I felt ready for treatment But, June 15th, I woke with awful calf pain. I was shaky. Scrambling eggs was exhausting. I was a back at the ER. This time for 2.5 days. CT scans and ultrasounds exposed extensive leg and pulmonary thromboses - just like dear old mom. On Riesman's oncology wing, I \"vacationed\" for five weeks. Doctors talked about removing half my liver, part of my stomach and the mass I insisted be called \"Bleedy\", to their dismay. But I was too unstable. Bleedy kept bleeding. There were so many conversations about tests, transfusions, and prognostications. I was sick of talking about me. The boredom! I greeted other patients, and, if willing, roommates and I shared our journeys. Often harrowing, prophetic tales. I often circumambulated the oncology wing, spying glimpses of a potential dark future. Families gathered in final moments. I implored nurses to sit, tell stories about their lives, dreams, show recommendations, new puppies, loves, a new engagement ring. I heard nurses jockeyed for me to be their patient -\" the happiest cancer patient ever.\" When asked how I could be so positive, I replied, \"The 12 steps of AA! Everyone should do them.\" Despite trying to stay positive and make connection, I didn't comprehend I was in danger. Due to a Covid outbreak, I was moved into the solarium. I reveled in the quiet, two walls of windows, an expansive view of transport helicopters. legendary soaring hawks and sunsets. Two weeks later, I fainted returning from the hallway bathroom. I was incontinent on waking up. I hid my face under a pillow and alerted my nurse about fainting. As she pulled back the sheets for cleanup, she gasped. I'd released mainly blood. A rush of staff attended to me. I was clinically unstable, near dead. I recently reviewed my medical records to discover I was on death watch that entire hospitalization. Five more transfusions later, I was told radiation would begin. Immuno and chemotherapy treatments started immediately after my fifth and final radiation round. I was knackered and moaned to nurse Francie, \"I'm so lazy. All I can do is lay here and sleep.\" She implanted my rally cry, \"Ya not lazy! Ya fightin' can-suh.\" Slowly, \"Bleedy\" stopped. I started to feel \"good\" and was released. Visiting nurses checked my condition and disconnected me from chemo. Friends helped me shop and treated me to meals. My radio show listeners reacted with moral and/or financial support. The anemia lessened. My stairs weren't such a problem. Three weeks later I was carrying my bike outside and upstairs, riding to and from treatments while still on the chemo drip. I'd shock friends and neighbors, \"Wanna know a secret?\" I'd reveal my fanny pack and protruding IV tube. \"I'm gettin' chemo right now!\" Mid-April 2024, chemotherapy stopped. I still get immunotherapy, but only every three weeks, likely for life. Dr. B beams I'm doing amazingly well. \"As close to a miracle with out being one.\" I am blessed. Maybe lucky. Nine-months of treatment, have been hard but not as bad as I feared. I still haven't thrown up, only negligible hair loss, and have experienced only a few debilitating side-effects my compatriots deal with. If in the wilderness, have a guide. I actively sought support groups which lead to \"BD\" of Boston Medical Center. I'm in his Men's and GI cancer groups. We do qigong/tai chi, meditation, spiritual healing, writing, crafts, museum tours, and holiday parties. They are understanding, sharing sherpas. In meditation, I was at war with cancer - an enemy invader, I wanted gone. That shifted after reading Gabor Mate's view of illness \"markers\" and the bodies alarm. \"BD\" recommended cancer \"thriver\" Denis DeSimone. Now, I see cancer is part of me. Hating cancer is hating a part of me. If I can love cancer, I've come all the way, teaching me valuable lessons. Most days, my buddy and me get along. Another blessing, my new PCP. He's older than me with a zillion credentials. After a full physical and records review, he said, \"First off, you're in excellent health and have a great attitude.\" \"Despite...\" \"Yes, despite. You're not old. Medically, eighty is old. Although we know things can change quickly, I see you have many good years ahead of you.\" I declared, it's not a death sentence, it's a life sentence. Meeting with Dr. B recently, I attributed my near miraculous recovery to her and the hemo/onclogy staff. She said, like always, \"No! It's all you. You're so amazing - just incredible. I paused, \"Ya know, It's beyond just us. There are so many spokes supporting the wheels of my recovery.\" During a four-day Thanksgiving hospital stay due to treatment related colitis, Reisman 11 nurses came by, they hated my return but loved seeing me. I told my main nurse, \"It's been a dark ride. But I see a lot of beauty. Cancer is sad and beautiful.\" About the Author A decades long freelance illustrator and a 35-year radio host at Boston college's WZBC 90.3 FM, James received a diagnosis of Stage IV metastatic esophageal cancer on Memorial Day weekend 2023.

    "data": "By Amber Soucy Pressure. I can feel it.Mentally: time constraints limit my bedside contact with patients. I need to be quicker, better, more efficient. But how? Policies are changing, protocol algorithms are rearranging, and all the while, more and more patients are deteriorating.Physical pressure: mask straps digging into the skin behind my ears, and hard, non-forgiving plastic face shields scrape and chafe my forehead and temples. My skin is breaking down, and behind that mask and shield, emotionally, so am I.Emotional pressure: I'm downtrodden. I want to give up but can't. I must persevere, I must continue on. Anxiety-ridden days roll into sleepless nights. Oxygen saturation alarms fill my ears. The sounds are deafening, and then the silence is the same once I'm alone in my bed. I can't escape the loneliness. I'm overflowing with grief. Could I have done more? Could I have saved them? Would my efforts have made a difference?Pressure, from every angle; it's just too much. I'm weighted down by it. Before nationwide restrictions were enacted, us nurses were just dipping our toes in and testing the waters. We still had control. So then we sat down at the water's edge and dangled from the knees down. As individuals, we held our own; we exerted our power and our rights. We were prepared.Then, there is an abundance of overtime shifts. I can't justify sitting on the sidelines feeling helpless, cautiously observing from a distance, especially knowing that I possess the training that could potentially make a difference. I can't watch from the shore as my team struggles to swim against the current. So I dive in headfirst, not knowing what forces will change the tide mid-swim.And boy, do those tides change. I paddle and paddle and swim in a circle, scoping out the scene to try to find the safest route to shore. But there isn't one. It's sharks to the left, with glimmering teeth and starving eyes, just waiting for me to make my move so they can pounce and eat me alive. Then there are the others, my friends, my coworkers; they're all screaming and flailing their arms in the air, attempting to flag down help or to alert others to send assistance. But there isn't enough personnel on the shoreline. There aren't enough resources to throw everyone a life jacket, and there isn't enough manpower to allocate a team to retrieve and resuscitate everyone drowning. It's every man for themselves.I'm viciously treading water. My head bobs up and down above and below the water. I'm barely hanging on. I'm drowning. And as I look around, everyone seems to share the same panic-stricken look. Although each is individually struggling to survive, we're all in this together.But then a boat arrives. They extract me from the turbulent waves and shark-infested waters. They wrap me up in a blanket and repeatedly tell me that \"it'll all be okay; you're safe now.\"But am I? Am I safe? Are we all safe? Or are we going to unexpectedly go swimming again in the same uncertain waters in the Fall?

    "data": "Little did I realize, as a survivor of trauma and loss, how much my lifelong capacity for wonder had been so vital to my recovery. I'd never recognized my ability to be amazed and wowed as a true strength, and no one I'd known had ever validated these qualities as a sign of strength, wisdom, or even maturity. If anything, being awestruck or wondrous was something akin to being gullible, naive, or childlike. Yet profoundly healing encounters with awe and wonder are common experiences for survivors of trauma and loss. Indeed, a powerful moment of awe with a great blue heron saved my life decades ago. Recently neuroscience has shown us the healing power of wonder, though previously underexplored and underappreciated. Now researchers echo what ecologist Rachel Carson believed was essential for human survival:\"Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.\" In the same spirit, I've launched a storytelling project and a YouTube channel calledHealing Through Wonder, dedicated to the resilience-building gifts of awe and wonder for those living with grief and trauma. Healing Through Wonderexplores the power of moments that take our breath away and open our minds. In a post-pandemic, cynical world where many of us have lost faith in humanity or lost time doomscrolling through social media, it's heartening to know that neuroscience research supports our awe-inspiring experiences despite the pessimism around us. Studies published by the Greater Good Science Center and the American Psychological Association show how our sense of wonder helps heal loneliness, trauma, and grief by giving us meaning, purpose, and a wider, more open perspective. In the past few years, exciting bestselling books such as Dacher Keltner'sAwe: The New Science of Everyday Wonder and How It Can Transform Your Lifehave been released on the neuroscience of wonder with evidence that even one moment of awe can transform our lives. Indeed, one moment of awe did truly change my life--or saved my life. My story centers around a profound encounter with a blue heron at the age of twenty-four. In 1979, as a homeless survivor of domestic violence, still running from my former partner, and in suicidal despair, I was ready to end it all at a campground alone by a river. I had a full bottle of valium in my hands, and beside me, another bottle of cheap red wine to wash it down. Out of the wide, twilight sky a majestic heron circled overhead and landed remarkably close to me--about ten feet away. In the dim, rising glow of the moon, the heron's piercing eyes stared into mine, and I froze in amazement, entranced, causing me to stop swallowing the pills. This moment of sheer awe saved my life, as I realized there was just too much beauty and magic in the world to give up. Naturally, after such a spiritual awakening, I followed herons to their wetland sanctuaries for years. Wandering and watching them quietly in their providence, I marveled at their stillness standing in shallow waters, or their determination to build nests with their mates, their elegance dancing in pairs as courtship, fishing, preening, and flying. I learned lessons about dignity, balance, grace, patience, the art of timing, and much more. After four decades of wondrous encounters with herons and studying the neuroscience of wonder, I've joined with a colleague, Robyn Houston-Bean, the founder of theSun Will Rise Foundation, to co-host storytelling sessions for ourHealing Through Wonderproject. Robyn has also found profound healing in experiences of awe and wonder and tells her story of a surprising encounter with a dragonfly after the death of her son, Nick. She describes a moment that took her breath away as the dragonfly stayed with her at her son's graveside as she grieved, resting on her arm, her hand, hovering around her, following her. In her amazement and attunement to the dragonfly, she welcomed a sense of connection with her son and a sense of oneness with everything around her, opening to a warm, reassuring sense of peace. She now believes, as strongly as I do, that people struggling with grief, trauma, or addiction can be encouraged to claim their sense of awe and wonder in their healing--in nature, as well as in music and the arts, in spiritual rituals, in adventures and quests to other lands, in marveling at human acts of courage and ingenuity. Through theSun Will Rise Foundation, Robyn facilitates groups for those who are grieving the death of a loved one due to substance use and she has heard many healing stories of wonder from group participants. Thanks to Robyn and other storytelling guests fromThe Sun Will Rise Foundationas well asstorytellers fromSADOD(Support After a Death by Overdose),ourHealing Through Wonderchannel includes firsthand accounts of wondrous encounters and uncanny synchronicities. Reflecting on these unexpected, life-changing moments, we examine the healing effects of what captivated and transformed us. Stories of wonder, awe, enchantment, and reverence that had been secretly tucked away for decades are generously shared on ourHealing Through Wonderchannel. Our stories show how our wellbeing thrives on our willingness to open ourselves to encounters of awe and wonder, no matter how brief or fleeting or odd. There's a whole, wide, dazzling world to amaze us beyond the din our overthinking minds, ruminations, or nagging inner chatter. Our willingness to look up and be amazed can turn a bad day around, or give us pause in a good way, or even change our whole outlook on life. As our project develops and as Robyn and I learn more about the healing power of awe and wonder, I'll be blogging here about the exciting science of awe as well as sharing experiences that have sparked our recovery from trauma and loss.

    "data": "Segment 4 of 6 in\"Soul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill\" by Shaler McClure Wright I'd like to thank Health Story Collaborative for working with me to bring you \"Soul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill.\" This monthly audio series offers a soulful perspective on the unique challenges of living with ongoing health conditions. My name is Shaler McClure Wright and I'm a writer/artist living with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. In Soul Chronicle One, \"Shifting the Body from Enemy to Ally,\" I spoke of how we might learn to see illness as an opportunity, and symptoms as clues pointing to something in our psyche that needs attention. Illness in the body offers us the chance to simultaneously ask ourselves, \"What in our soul might need healing too?\" Where is the sorrow, regret or soul-wound that might be bonded with this physical pain? And then we might notice that when we pay attention to our soul-pain, our physical pain benefits. This widening of the lens, or reframing of our health circumstances can be a powerful tool. And the more we practice listening to our body's wisdom, the more we can appreciate our body's deep connection with soul. But nothing in life is static. And over time, we're bound to face unpleasant circumstances that work to break this connection. Just last month, my soulful perspective was challenged. After the holidays, like thousands of others, I got a breakthrough infection of Omicron. I imagine many of you have had Omicron too, and if not, maybe you're faced with fear of it as an unknown. So I'd like to share my experience. For the record, I was lucky; for me it was mostly like a bad case of the flu. But instead of giving you a list of my symptoms and discomforts, I'd like to read you one of my favorite poems, one I return to when I feel ill. This time I'll use it as a way to talk about elements of my covid experience. Here is \"Illness; a Conversation\" by Joyce Sidman, from her children's book \"What the Heart Knows.\" Sidman is having a conversation with her body while ill: \"I asked my feet why they could not walk and they said, We are treading water. I asked my legs why they buckled and fell and they said, We are growing roots. I asked my fingers why they had loosened their grip on the world and they said, It is too hard to hold. We are gathering clouds instead. Why? I asked my eyes, which kept crying and crying, and they said, We are waiting for the very last tear. Speak! I told my lips, but my voice was not my own. So I asked my heart, Who am I now? and my heart said, The you underneath the you. And I asked my soul, Who will I be? and my soul answered, The one whose heart is open, the one whose eyes are clear, the one whose hands are full of sky.\" During Omicron, the first hint I had that something was wrong was feeling an overwhelming urge to lie down in the middle of the day. I just wanted to get off my feet because my legs were aching. Perhaps Sidman has felt a similar ache: \"I asked my feet why they could not walk and they said, we are treading water.\" When our bodies are fighting an infection we need to give them all the energy we can muster. And if at some point our bodies resist movement, it's because beneath the surface, our bodies are working hard to keep us afloat. While fighting Omicron, it helped me to imagine having web-like feet, paddling to hold me steady over the surface of a deep pool of discomfort. I knew the pain was there, and every so often I might drift into a cold spot that chilled me to the bone, but my treading feet kept me away from the coldest parts. \"I asked my legs why they buckled and fell and they said, we are growing roots.\" Fatigue and lack of strength are also part of the Omicron experience, and each time I tried to get up and get things done, my shaky legs made it clear I was going nowhere. So instead of persisting, I used that time to imagine deepening my roots in the world, and that image gave me permission to surrender to stillness. \"I asked my fingers why they had loosened their grip on the world and they said, it is too hard to hold. We are gathering clouds instead.\" Sometimes we need a break from the pressures of daily life, and one of the opportunities of illness (if you will), is time. When we're stuck in bed we can use that time to redirect our attention and visualize the world as we would like to see it. Or perhaps more to the point, as we would like tofeelit. For me, the image of gathering clouds feels much like gathering hopes and dreams. Much better than worrying! And just as it's not possible to catch a cloud with a clenched fist, it's also not possible to dream a dream until we loosen our hold on the fear that keeps us from falling asleep. \"I asked my heart, who am I now? And my heart said, the you underneath the you.\" When I was sick with Omicron I had a week-long headache that made it hard to think straight. I couldn't read or write and barely had the energy to watch tv. My brain was not in charge. So for me, 'the you underneath the you' is my heart-self rather than my head-self. And in times of illness, our heart-self cuts through the tangled web of our thinking mind, to clear the way for inner strength to rise. \"I asked my soul, who will I be? And my soul answered, 'The one whose heart is open, the one whose eyes are clear, the one whose hands are full of sky.'\" When we feel ill we can't help but wonder how the experience might change us. \"Who am I now?\" \"How long will it take to get back my energy? What if I'm left weaker?\" And if any of these things turn out to be true, the next step would be to put them in perspective, holding them shoulder to shoulder with the aspects of ourselves that illness makes stronger--our compassion, awareness and appreciation of beauty. And from that vantage point, though still significant, the potential remnants of illness are less looming. One thing that Sidman does not address is the loneliness that often accompanies illness. When I had Omicron, I needed to isolate from my family, and it was the sense isolation that was hardest for me. Feeling alone while in pain can make the pain feel more intense. Feeling alone while in pain opens the door to worry. And when worry makes her entrance, we're likely to hear a round of unwelcome but familiar ruminations circling through our minds. \"What if there's?... Is that from?.. Will it also?...\" You know the drill. When anticipatory anxiety powers our mental list of things to worry about, it's exhausting, circular and endless. Like a hamster on a wheel. And if not reckoned with, our anticipatory anxiety can grow even stronger--into generalized health anxiety, where we fear the worst for our bodies without clear reason. That said, for those of us with chronic illness, the possibility of developing Long Covid is a very real concern. Could Omicron (even though it's thought to be relatively mild) be capable of leaving us with Long Covid, as the other strains have? After Omicron I worried that every lingering discomfort might be caused by some residual virus taking up permanent residence in my body. I imagined it as a stealth invader, hiding in wait. And that weakened my resolve to heal--not a trade off anyone with chronic illness should be willing to make. Even if Omicron doesn't cause much harm on its own, could it still serve as a catalyst, or triggering event for the return of older, more familiar symptoms? With Omicron, our anticipatory fear can be more intense because the virus is shrouded in mystery. Because it is new. Because people with ongoing health conditions, having supposedly recovered from Covid, may only now be realizing how the virus is still affecting them. And, here's the part we don't like to hear when speaking of anticipatory fear--anticipatory fear is dangerous because sometimes fear itself can manifest the pain. There. I said it. The fear of Long Covid can plant us firmly on the unwelcome doorstep of somatic illness; a threshold we prefer not to cross. I remind myself that I have many tools to cope with illness. If the Omicron variant were to persist, or trigger other symptoms, well, I know how to handle it--step by step and breath by breath. And when I feel my anxiety ratcheting up, I use the power of soul to calm my fear. Joyce Sidman's poem, \"Illness, a Conversation\" speaks to my soul. Do you have a poem, painting, sculpture, place, or song that speaks to your soul? If we can remain open, fear can be an invitation to dialogue with soul. Swiss psychologist Carl Jung tells us, \"Soul and body are not two things. They are one.\" (Carl Jung, Zarathustra Seminar, p 355.) When we partner with soul, our bodies have a better chance of staying in the moment and handling one discomfort at a time. It might be a struggle, but it's a fight worth fighting. Fear is corrosive to our health. Soul is restorative. Be kind to yourself and choose Soul.

    "data": "By Kelly Keena I wouldn't say I was reckless, instead I would call it young and lacking confidence. I was a college student, living with two friends in a fabulous neighborhood in east Denver, waiting tables, and living a very active, ahem, nightlife. Never any of the big drugs, mostly drinks. A lot of drinks. And cigarettes, dammit. When I did not feel good on my twenty-first birthday, I pushed through. Stubbornness has nearly killed me and saved me. I went out anyway to the bar owned by the future Governor and played pool with my friends and did shots of whatever they handed me. The next day, I felt more than hungover. A week later, I was in a drug-induced coma with a stubborn staph infection in my lungs. My last rights were read, my friends told to say their goodbyes. And then, I woke up and recovered for the next seven weeks in the hospital. This was the beginning of a very long slog through a chronic disease. Two years later I had the diagnosis of bronchiectasis due to the infection that ripped through the lower left and upper right lobes of my lungs. Two places that live inside my body that are unable to do their jobs. As a grad student doing my internship teaching environmental education, I taught form and function as related to the beauty of the natural world. The form of my lungs overtaken by an infinitely small bacteria and they could no longer function. My friend's mom offered me a job at her small coffee shop right off of the main artery to the Rocky Mountains, at the highway exit where I argue you get the most spectacular welcoming view of the first range of snow-covered peaks. We had some tourists, but our customers were mostly locals from the mansions and less-than-mansions scattered throughout the trees. One of these regulars was a nurse in the cystic fibrosis (CF) unit at our Children's Hospital For months we shared a similar exchange. She would hear me cough and say, \"That sounds like a CF cough.\" And I would reply something like, \"It's not CF. It's bronchiectasis from my staph infection.\" I called it \"my\" infection because somehow I had proclaimed it as part of my identity. She would then reply, \"You should ask your doctor.\" I would hand her the coffee and thank her. Finally, I did ask my doctor. We would have a similar exchange as the nurse and I, only this time I was on the other side of the argument. He eventually caved and ordered a sweat chloride test. There is a higher concentration of salt in the sweat of people with CF and this is used as a diagnostic tool. To measure the salt content, they put a solution on a small cotton pad on the inside of my forearm. They connected electrodes that created tiny buzzing pulses causing the area to sweat, which was absorbed by the cotton pad. It didn't hurt, the sensation was more like an annoying scratch. The nurse attached the electrodes and casually said, \"CF, huh. You should have been dead a long time ago.\" I guess I didn't know what CF was. Two weeks later, I was studying for an exam with a friend sitting at her oak brown kitchen table worn by the coloring of her young daughter. My doctor called and I listened to him say that the test was inconclusive. I stared at the framed photo of my friend's mom in a funky dress, pregnant with my friend and holding a cigarette in one hand, a martini in the other. Our medical understandings have evolved so much in our short lifetimes. I went back for more tests. They drew blood and sent it for genetic sequencing. In total, the process took about two years. Two weeks before my wedding to the man who does not wince when I cough, in my parents' backyard with the same beautiful Rocky Mountain backdrop, I received a call from National Jewish respiratory hospital. I had cystic fibrosis. I needed to come in and connect with the adult CF clinic. That same summer, a 63-year-old man was also diagnosed with CF. On the heels of the diagnosis, I had pneumonia again, one week before the wedding. I had pneumonia three to four times a year since the staph infection. Stress had a way of laying me out. On good days, my cough sounded like a gurgle of sludge. With pneumonia, the gurgling was muffled, my lungs full of putty-like mucus, drowning in my own body. Planning big events is difficult as pneumonia was difficult to pencil into the calendar. This hospital visit was new. Different. I had a private room without the flimsy curtain that was intended to separate patients but didn't. Everyone from the medical teams and custodians and those delivering trays of rubbery food was gowned, masked, and gloved. I felt like an alien under investigation. Only later did I learn that the protective measures akin to what we are all so used to seeing throughout Covid, were to keep from spreading a special bacterium common in CF patients. I was not yet skilled in the art of asking questions and advocating for myself. I just sort of went with it. My doctor and nurse had wry humor and wit and a reasonable dose of seriousness. They listened to me, to my lungs and to my words. They continue to lead my care team more than twenty years later. With CF now added to my identity, I got an IV between my toes. The veins in my arms protested any attempt to intrude. I was grateful for their resistance. I had a sleeveless wedding dress and avoided the dark purple and yellow smears that lasted for weeks after the needles. I never got to tell that nurse that she diagnosed me. Without her, I wonder if anyone would have figured out that I had this genetic recessive disease if she didn't like coffee. Nettie, if you're out there, thank you. I call CF my 2x4 to the head, my awakening into self-care. I still feel a bit of shame when they refer to me as a former smoker at the clinic. I automatically reply, \"I was young.\" My husband who doesn't wince when I cough calls it my \"sit-your-ass-down\" disease. In my late teens and early twenties, I was not taking care of myself. I didn't know who I was aside from wanting to teach children how fragile and resilient our natural world is. I learned that I am also fragile and resilient. CF is now my barometer and friend that tells me when it's time to rest, take good care, and sit my ass down. The acceptance was not readily available, though. I am only talking about having CF now, after all this time, to you and even to my family. It has been an intensely private experience. Like my hardened off veins, I shuttered my life with a chronic disease from everyone. I commonly hear, \"but you don't look sick.\" Even my husband and daughter are just now learning about the intricacies of CF inside of my mind, although they are most attuned to my lived experience. I will always wonder why it is so much easier to write for strangers than to admit such things to the two people who are my world. CF for me is not as much about the illness as it is about the recovery. Chronic healing is a life of getting laid out and then getting up again. And again. And again. Resilience can be a tricky term, sometimes used to shame those of us who can't get up again. I argue that there is nothing wrong or bad about laying down for a while. Recently, I laid down for five years crippled by depression and anxiety from repetitive hospitalizations. I think there is a misunderstanding of chronic disease, that it is always the physical illness. It's not. It's actually always the looming threat of illness while working to maintain the demands of life. And being easy on ourselves for the complex mental gymnastics that accompanies normalcy and illness. Chronic disease is as chronic for the body as it is for the mind. Chronic illness has become my greatest teacher. It reveals the grand paradoxes of my one life - the beauty of small things like a bird call and the pain of large things like cancelling an international trip with my daughter the morning of departure because my lungs were bleeding. Chronic healing has meant a life of appreciation, acceptance, and yes, sometimes terrible physical pain and mental exhaustion. Chronic healing is what we do in chronic disease. We don't have a choice. It takes us to the edge and then allows us to recover. What I do in that recovery, I hope, defines me more than when I lay down and surrender to a rest.

    "data": "2018 was starting to become a difficult year. I was 40 years old and preparing to be a single mother of four children. I had been divorced for 5 years from the father of my oldest three children - Corbin, Grace, and Cohen - and my relationship with Steve, the father of my youngest child, Grayson, was ending. The 4th of July had snuck up on me that year with everything going on and falling on a Wednesday in the middle of the week. Normally I would have a party at home with friends and family but with the stress of paying bills on my own I agreed to a double shift instead. Rather than everyone being together, the children all made plans with friends. My oldest child, Corbin, wanted to float down the river on tubes with some friends. Even though he was already 16, I was still a little hesitant about letting him go. Corbin was a good kid. He worked as many hours as he could so he had a truck to drive, did well in school, was never in trouble and really had taken on the man of the house role helping me with everything he was asked. He was a mature and responsible child but teenage boys will be teenage boys regardless. I feel like I've always been a little over protective and as a parent you struggle with the balance between not wanting to keep them in a bubble and not giving too much freedom. Reluctantly, I agreed. Before I left for work I wanted to verify the plans with Corbin one last time. Corbin was in the bathroom when I came downstairs. He had just gotten out of the shower so he was speaking to me through the door. I wanted to see him, and of course I wanted to give him a hug goodbye, but he argued a little and told me he would call me with his plans. I was running late, so we said goodbye through the door. That day at work, my first and only customer was a man I hadn't seen in years. His son and Corbin used to go to school together. We started talking about how scary it is when kids grow up, get their licenses, and go out on their own - celebrating holidays with friends rather than family. He started telling me a story about how his son had just gotten into a car accident on the highway. Luckily no one involved, including his son, was injured. Before he could finish the story, I got a text message from Steve, Grayson's father, \"It's an emergency!\" it said. He was out of town with my two-year-old son that day and all I could think was that something must have happened with my child. I interrupted my customer and excused myself to make a phone call. It wasn't my son, it was my nephew. An emergency location-tracking app sent a notification to my sister-in-law that my nephew, Tanna, had been in an accident and was trapped in the vehicle. My sister-in-law couldn't get a hold of me so they called Steve to find me. They knew I was the closest person to the accident. I immediately asked where and if he was okay before realizing that Corbin was supposed to be with him. But Corbin hadn't called me yet to tell me he was leaving so Corbin couldn't be with him, I tried to tell myself. The short drive down that road felt like it took an hour. It was like watching a horror movie when you hear the terrifying music and you just know something awful is about to happen. I didn't know what I was going to see. I came around the corner to see several flashing lights. What was once a tar road was now covered in so much dirt it felt like a different road. There were branches and large pieces of wood everywhere. I drove as close as I could, then got out of my car and started sprinting towards the wreck until a police officer stopped me. I was blank, - none of this felt real, like this isn't my life, this can't be happening. I could barely speak while looking at a white convertible, with a dark interior, on its side up against a tree. But I only saw one car and none of Corbin's friends had a white convertible. I was confused. I looked at the officer and said, \"I think my nephew was in this accident.\" He asked his name and verified that he was. It took all I had in me to ask him if Corbin was also in the car. Yes, he confirmed. There had been 4 boys in the car and Corbin's injuries were the most severe, he told me. \"What do you mean most severe, what kind of injuries?\" I asked. \"He was alive when he left in the ambulance,\" is all he told me. Not comforting words to a mother seeking answers. I ran back to my car and raced to the hospital. I think I made 100 frantic phone calls on the way. I called my daughter Grace to tell her Corbin was in the accident and ask who drove a white convertible with red stickers. She said it was his friend, Tyler. They weren't driving a convertible - the roof had been removed to get the boys out. The car had a light interior, not dark, but the seats were now covered in blood. When I arrived at the hospital my mom and sister in law were standing in the ER trying to get information, and more and more friends and family kept showing up. After what felt like an hour, a nurse walked in and asked which one of us was Corbin's mother and I stood up. She said, \"Come with me.\" As we started to walk down the hallway she wrapped her arms around me and braced me like I was going to fall. She said nothing. She just held me up. Then, all of a sudden, there he was. Corbin was on a stretcher - naked and lifeless - with 20 people around him rushing in and out of the large room. He was covered in blood and hooked up to all kind of machines. The nurse pulled up a chair and told me to sit. My brother had come with us and was standing behind me rubbing my shoulders trying to reassure me that Corbin was going to be ok, he was going to pull through this. It felt like standing still in the middle of a freeway while everything flies past you. No one told me what was going on, no one explained his injuries or what they were doing to him. I had no idea why they had brought me down to see this and before I knew it, the same nurse grabbed me and walked me back to the waiting room. I had no information to report except the horror I had seen. I felt helpless. Eventually a doctor rushed into the room and told us Corbin had suffered a severe head injury and that they might need to remove part of his skull to let his brain swell. He had internal bleeding and punctured lungs among many other injuries, and they were rushing him into surgery. I signed the consent and asked what his chances were. She wouldn't give a straight answer. She just reiterated how severe his injuries were and ran out the door. I just kept telling myself \"not Corbin, not my child.\" I felt like I was trying to will him out of this, and I wasn't going to stop. A few hours had gone by at this point and about 30 friends and family had shown up, including Corbin's cousin Paul. Paul had worked in the medical field for years. He had been a 911 operator as well as a member of a medical transport team in Boston for 9 years. He asked me what I knew and if I felt like I had all of the information I needed. Of course I didn't. I felt lost. He brought me back down to the ER and asked the doctor, who had worked on Corbin, if we could speak to him. He agreed and the three of us sat down. Paul asked all kinds of medical questions and I just remember being blank. I just wanted to know if my son was going to live. At the end of the conversation Paul asked \"if Corbin survives surgery do you think he should be transported to a level one trauma center?\" The doctor said no, he believed their team could handle it. We thanked him and went back upstairs. Paul explained the difference in hospitals to me on the way upstairs and how a level one trauma center deals with these kinds of severe traumas every day. Paul believed that's where Corbin should go, should he make it through surgery. I trusted him and agreed. He survived the surgery--a huge victory but then the surgeon and a neurologist came to talk to us. Corbin had no brain activity, the neurologist said, and he wasn't going to survive. We needed to prepare to say good bye. \"WAIT WHAT???!!!\" Everyone started sobbing or screaming. I was just thinking \"NO! NO! He's alive, I'll take him anyway I can get him.\" I felt like they were giving up. I refused to start grieving. Two of my other children, Grace and Cohen, came over and were on my lap crying. I was trying to console them by hugging them but I couldn't speak. There were no words. I felt very robotic. My mother was loudly sobbing but growing increasingly more concerned with my lack of reaction. I heard her tell the Doctor she needed to give me something because I was in shock. Corbin's dad Jeff, who had just arrived, ran through the hall screaming \"not my boy!\" Aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends were all in groups hugging each other and crying, but they all keep looking over at me. The surgeon came over and knelt beside me, she started rubbing my arm and explaining how bad his head injury was. I just looked at her and said \"but he's alive?\" She said \"yes but....\" I interrupted, \"then I want him transferred to Boston Children's Hospital and I want to see him.\" She said \"well I don't know if they'll take him, he might not be stable enough.\" I insisted. She agreed to try and walked away. I knew she took me seriously. I have a laid-back personality for the most part until we're dealing with my children - then a whole other protective, 'don't stand in my way,' side comes out. They let Corbin's dad and I in to see him. Corbin was so broken, barely recognizable, but I felt comfort being by his side, feeling his warm hand and watching his chest slowly move up and down, even if a machine was making it happen. He had multiple facial and spinal fractures, several skull fractures with one even pinching off a main artery to his brain, two punctured lungs, torn bowels, two broken shoulder blades, a collar bone broken in two different spots, internal bleeding, brain bleeds, and many more injuries. Within an hour, Corbin was on a helicopter to Boston. Steve and I stood in the ER as we watched them take off with Corbin. Another helpless feeling. Protecting him felt out of my control when I couldn't be near him. Corbin went through a lot in that first 24 hours. Concord Hospital had removed his spleen, repaired a torn bowel, placed a monitor in his skull and left an open incision in his abdomen from his pelvis to his ribs. Once in Boston he was rushed into a second surgery and had a second monitor with a drain placed in his skull, internal bleeding repaired and more than half of his blood transfused. We spent the next 50 nights, with the majority of them in the ICU, at Boston Children's Hospital. At first our goal was for him to survive the next 24 hours... and then the next 48 hours... and then the next 72 hours... and even when they finally believed he would survive, they told me they didn't believe he would regain much brain function. \"Not Corbin, Not my child,\" I kept saying. I was given so many negative predictions that eventually I just stopped listening. I couldn't help but believe that Corbin was still in that body. Corbin's sister and I spent every night in that room with him. We played his favorite music, we read him sports news, we told him stories, we brought familiar things from home like is pillowcase and favorite blanket so that he might recognize the smell. The first day he opened his eye and looked at me, I finally saw Corbin. I didn't see a blank stare. He was in there. Still, the doctors told me he would most likely need to spend the rest of his life in a long-term care facility, but I never gave up. I told the doctors I knew he was capable of more - he just needed more time. Corbin was awake but not for long periods. He had just started to respond yes and no through thumbs up or down, sometimes. He had a tracheostomy tube for his airway and a feeding tube for his nutrition. He was still on monitors and many medications, but slowly, he got better. 50 days after his accident Spaulding Rehab hospital finally agreed to take him. I felt like we had won the lottery. It had all paid off. All the sleepless nights, all the persistence, all the never giving up even when you have the most intelligent doctors in the world giving you negative information. I knew we were going to do this, I knew everything was going to be alright. When he first got to Spaulding, he wasn't talking or walking. He had a feeding tube and a tracheostomy. But he spent 41 days pushing his body and his mind to do things we were told he would never do again. On November 1st, he walked out of Spaulding, talking and eating regular food. 91 days after I was told to say goodbye to Corbin, he was back home with his family and so close to his old self. He graduated from High School last month. But our lives are forever changed. Our days are still filled with tutoring and therapy, but I wouldn't change any of it for a second. We cherish the time we have now - the times we have nothing to do but sit around the kitchen counter and just talk and laugh - that we would have taken for granted before. When you are faced with never seeing a loved one again, never being able to hug them or kiss them, you realize how much every moment counts. I had a nurse at Spaulding tell me that the support Corbin had is why he made this kind of recovery. She said she had been doing the job for years, and yes of course the medical part of it plays a huge role. But beyond just being alive, Corbin thrived. Having his family by his side, showing him the love and support, is what gives people the will to fight and keep pushing. I believe in the power of love and positivity. So many people have told me they wouldn't have been able to do the things I've done, but I don't believe that. I believe we all have an inner strength we know nothing about until we're put to this kind of test. We have to keep positivity even when there seems to be nothing to be positive about. Find the smallest thing and hold onto it. For me, it was the fact Corbin was alive. As long as he was still alive, I wasn't giving up.",

    "data": "At the age of 17 at an all-male boarding school in Virginia, Jenks developed what would grow into a life-threatening eating disorder. It began with over-exercising, and quickly spiraled into bulimia, stimulant abuse, and drug and alcohol addiction. Over the following ten years, the eating disorder ruled Jenks's life and took uncountable things away from him. He hid his disorder for years, ashamed to tell friends and family that he was struggling with what was considered by many to be a \"women's disease.\" It did not help that he did not know any males with eating issues to whom he could turn for advice. Eventually, Jenks opened up to his family about his co-occurring issues with alcohol, drugs, and food. Hospitalizations and treatment programs helped him address his substance addiction first, but in the absence of those behaviors the eating disorder surged. He realized his pattern of trying to fill the void he felt inside with whatever was at hand: drugs, alcohol, relationships, exercise, or food. Now 31 and in solid recovery, Jenks discusses the mixed feelings he had for years about letting go of his eating disorder: part of him wanted freedom, but another part was unwilling to give up the rituals. When Jenks began his journey towards recovery in earnest, at a treatment center called A New Journey in Santa Monica, California, it was not without stumbles. From these experiences, Jenks realized his passion for service. He describes how his recovery is based in giving back to others who are themselves recovering from alcohol and drug addiction and eating disorders. One of Jenks's primary missions is to encourage men to engage in open conversations about their struggles with food, which he believes is the essential first step to healing. Originally from Rock Hill, South Carolina, Jenks currently resides in Venice, California where he works as a House Manager in a sober living house for men.",

    "data": "My social anxiety plays me like a deceitful little game, except I spent the last 15 years pretending like I wasn't on the court. The painful shyness I faced as a child, my inability to smile at any adults except my parents until the age of eight, the meeting with my fourth-grade teacher that my concerned mother sat through, afraid her daughter wasn't voicing her needs: it's always been you, dear social anxiety. My conviction in middle school that my friends didn't care about having me around: that was you, too, wasn't it? You pushed and pushed with such excruciating force until that stupid conviction became my reality. As did tears, insecurity, and a lack of reassurance I desperately needed. In high school you hid behind black skinny jeans, punk rock band t-shirts, and an eating disorder that wasn't glamorous like in the movies. You danced around obsession, meticulous numbers, and crippling self-judgment. This is my reality, and the reality of millions of other people. And we are being ignored. What if our society ignored the number of people who suffered from cancer each year? What if we claimed that cancer wasn't real and its effect on lives was simply a conjugation of one's imagination? If we stigmatized this illness, how would it impact those 15 million Americans who live with it? How would it make them feel? We don't ignore those battling a physical illness because it's usually easy to see how they manifest, yet mental health disorders can be harder to see and are thus treated differently. The number of people who live with cancer every year is equivalent to the number of North Americans who live with social anxiety. That's roughly 7 percent of our continent's population. The disorder is more prevalent among teenagers and college students: an estimated 10 percent of college students suffer from significant social anxiety disorder, and general anxiety disorder affects an astounding 25 percent of teenagers. So why is the second most commonly diagnosed form of anxiety disorder is also so commonly overlooked? It's challenging enough to live with a mental illness: its stigmatized reputation is an additional obstacle to overcome. The stigma American society has so carelessly placed upon those struggling with social anxiety is rooted in insensitivity and judgment. The ignorance that drives this stigma not only discourages people from seeking help but attempts to convince them they have no problem to begin with. The pressure to break out of the shyness and nervousness becomes debilitating. When someone is repeatedly told their struggles don't exist or their social awkwardness is just something they need to suck up and get over, we begin to believe it. I know I did. My social anxiety made me question all the wrong things. I questioned the value of my curvy physique. I questioned my ability to be alone for hours at a time and not crave any verbal exchange. I questioned why people assumed I was so shy when I didn't raise my hand in class, even though I always knew I had something to offer. At the time, I didn't know what kept restricting me. I had questioned why everyone I knew was making friends at college, while my \"friends\" kicked me out of their roommate pool instead. My first semester in college drained me. The pressure of constant socialization and having to present my best, bubbly, and agreeable self to everyone I confronted took a toll on my mental health. If I was anything but outgoing and always eager to go out on a weeknight, I was afraid my worst internal fear would come true--people would only pretend to be my friend because they felt a sense of pity towards me. I spend an exorbitant amount of energy and time rehearsing what tone I would use to respond to my name during attendance call in class, or considering which shoes would make the least noise when I walked into a 300-student lecture. One night my roommate asked me to make a phone call to the resident hall janitor because our window was jammed. I knew exactly the look I shot her, one brimming with such nerves and astonishment that makes someone wonder if they've suddenly sprouted a second head. She stared back at me quizzically and within seconds quickly muttered, \"Never mind, I'll do it.\" The conversation ended abruptly. Why couldn't I do it? Social anxiety. But now I know it's you, anxiety. Things make sense now: why I over-think the most basic social interactions, why I can't present an accurate first impression no matter how hard I try, and why making friends is a hurdle I never fail to trip over. I need constant reassurance from the people in my life that I matter to them; that they want me to be there, and I haven't just shoved my way in. I understand now that you are the driving force behind that heavy weight of insecurity that has traveled with me throughout my first year of college. But I want you to know that I am not afraid of you. Coming to college has given me the courage to speak openly about the daily challenges you provide. Because of you, I have discovered my passion of advocating for mental health awareness. I have overcome my eating disorder. I have made a friend or two, and I'm working on making some more. Thank you for being a constant in my life, dear social anxiety. Yes, you are a piece of me. But if you think you are going to define me, you are so painfully mistaken.

    "data": "By Michael McBryde King Different: quite the apt word to describe my journey, but one that is uniquely appropriate. I am what is called a nontraditional student at Cape Fear Community College in the human service/substance use recovery program. The standard definition for a nontraditional student is one who has a gap of three to five years between high school and college. I repeat, that's three years, not three decades. It's okay; that's your cue to laugh! I should explain why I had such a large gap between high school and my college career. Through a series of unfortunate events and admittedly poor decision-making, I began my decades-long history with alcoholism. It wasn't until the winter of 2018, when I was forty-three years old, that I decided to make a change. For years, I had been stuck in a cycle of dead-end jobs and alcoholism, self-medicating to run away from life's problems. Unfortunately, drinking doesn't make the problems go away; it only hits the pause button. For months, I had been feeling off, low energy, bloated, and constantly gaining weight. I came to the realization that I was spending all my time thinking about drinking. I was sick of feeling sorry for myself; it was time for something different, something positive. In 2019, for the first time in many years, I wanted to create a New Year's resolution: to take a break from drinking; what I didn't realize was that my body had other things in mind. During this \"break,\" instead of feeling better, I started feeling worse, much worse. Finally, it got to the point where, in late March 2019, I had to check into the ER. It was then that I was diagnosed with end-stage liver failure, a terminal condition. While telling me this, the look on my doctor's face was as though I was fit for a pine box. Lying on my back on the ER gurney, I was informed about the MELD score. MELD is an acronym that stands for Measure of End-Stage Liver Disease: on a 30-point scale, I was listed as a 27, which means I was only three points from needing an emergency transplant. Over the next week, I received a series of five paracentesis, a procedure in which a needle catheter is inserted into the parthenium (fluid sac inside the belly) to extract excess fluid buildup. If the excess fluid is not relieved, a rupture could occur; too much fluid extraction could cause kidney failure or heart attack. That month, I received 15, at a total of 150 L relieved via needle catheter. During my month in the hospital, I had what could only be called an existential awakening. With nothing but time on my hands, I realized I needed to make a change; fortunately, many people were there to help me. The nurses, physician's assistants, and doctors were the first of many people assisting me in saving and changing my life. After my release from the hospital, I saw a series of doctors and learned that I needed a liver transplant; I was told a transplant was the only way I could save my life. I needed to seek professional therapeutic assistance to qualify for a liver transplant. Thus began my journey into professional mental health and substance use therapy at Coastal Horizons Inc. At Coastal, I finally started to understand what I needed to do for myself and what I wanted to do with the rest of my life: help others the same way I was helped. I am happy to say that, as my mental health improved, my medical condition did as well. After receiving my certificate of completion from Coastal, I took the advice of my therapist and began my pursuit of becoming a North Carolina-Certified Peer Support Specialist. To do this, I had to do something I had neglected for many years: complete my high school education. To achieve this task, I enrolled in the adult high school program at Cape Fear; after obtaining my high school diploma, I received training at the Harrelson Center and became a Volunteer Peer Support Specialist. While volunteering my services, I realized I wanted to do more for those I helped; to do this, I once again enlisted the help of Cape Fear and started the next leg of my educational journey. Like many others, I have taken the opportunity to set the course of my life in a new direction. It is a direction that can provide me with a better, more stable income and provide others with the help they need to overcome one of life's most crippling obstacles: drug addiction and alcoholism. My life's goal is to give these people the support they need, not by providing them a hot meal or a shirt for their back, but by offering them the tools they need to make the right decisions for themselves. My path, or my tool, if you will, was CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) with the assistance of my therapist, a licensed clinical addiction specialist. Once I had an educated, nonjudgmental sounding board, I was able to make remarkable changes quickly. I was also able to help others in my IOP (intensive outpatient) group therapy by sharing my story and telling them about my previous thought process and how my decision-making abilities were evolving. How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Take the Red Line to Columbia! Last summer, I attended the American Psychological Association conference held inWashington, D.C., as one of only 75 student volunteers chosen in the nation. While there, I took a one-day excursion to New York City via Amtrak and toured the campus of Columbia University. After my tour, I was pointed in the direction of the Columbia General Studies (GS) office; it was there that I met an admissions officer who was impressed by my academic experience, so much so that she gave me a Dean's referral. This awarded me an application fee waiver and expedited application review. With only three days, I gathered my letters of reference and transcripts and wrote my statement of purpose essay. Guess what? It worked! I'm proud to say that I will be attending The School of General Studies at Columbia University in the City of New York this fall! GO LIONS!The fellowship and guidance I have received during my academic adventures can be summed up with a quote from Buddha: \"Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the single candle will not be shortened. Happiness will never decrease by being shared.\" So be generous with your time, your patience, your understanding, and your love so that you and all those in your orbit can be happier for it! We are all beings of infinite capacity, infinite love, infinite ability to learn, and infinite generosity. Oh, there's one final update to add. Less than a month ago, I had a check-up. My MELD score on the newly revised 40-point scale is an 8. As of May 2024, I no longer carry the diagnosis of end-stage liver failure; it's over. I am successfully off the transplant list. I officially have a new lease on life! So, with that, I bring this chapter of my life to a close, but don't worry; there are plenty more chapters coming up--all we need do is turn the page. Stay tuned for updates, and don't worry; I'll keep everyone informed on my new journey into the Columbia Blue!

    "data": "By Shaler Wright Every year I make the same wish on my birthday. No matter how many candles there are to blow out, I close my eyes, take a breath and wish -- to sleep. Deeply, peacefully, without pain, and without medication. Hamlet's words ring out like a hopeful refrain in my mind. \"To sleep, perchance to dream\" is my mantra to self-charge when endurance runs low. Doctors don't know what to make of me. Such a bright, well spoken, friendly woman. But those widespread symptoms? That intermittent pain, migrating aches? And those inconclusive test results! \"She's so high functioning in daily life, what could possibly be wrong?\" My complaints can't be neatly gathered under a classic diagnosis, so it's been repeatedly suggested that my discomforts are a fluke, not really so bad, the result of stress, or dramatic imagination. And then I'm offered that familiar, dismissive smile that lets me know I've come to the end of another road. I brace myself for what comes next... \"Have you ever considered therapy?\", they ask. I sigh quietly, \"Yes I have, but I'm willing to try again.\" And snip-snap, just like that I'm referred to a psychiatrist to learn how to become less ill. This is the repetitive cycle of my health story. After thirty years and a cornucopia of psychiatric medications that made me feel worse, I learned that the best way to feel better is to stop telling doctors I don't feel well. It's not worth the risk, the humiliation or shame. And it's definitely not worth the side effects of the latest and greatest pill, or the months lost while trying tobe patient and give it timeto work. I've given decades! So, lack of patience is not my problem. Nor is lack of compliance. My problem is that doctors -- through no fault of their own -- haven't been asking the right questions or ordering the right tests. But I didn't know that at the time, and I hadn't yet learned to trust my own experience of my body. Instead, I learned to believe that I am the problem. \"I'm a wimp. A complainer. Dramatic\" And that didn't feel good. So I adapted. I trained my brain to tolerate pain and label it as merely discomfort. I diminished my feelings to the point of dissociating from my body. And I learned to separate my perception of pain from my experience of pain. Distraction became my greatest ally. \"If I can't make the pain go away (and since I've been told it isn't even real), I'll just ignore it.\" Hmmph. The problem with that technique is that you lose touch with what is real and what is not. And you start to feel like a fake, like you're the emperor with no clothes, but the only one you're fooling is yourself. And you begin to doubt yourself, not just in relation to your health, but also your opinions on other matters. You give up your own sense of true north and are left without a personal compass. Who can you believe, who can you trust, when you can't even trust yourself? For me, the answer came unexpectedly. Like my own personal Mary Poppins riding in from the east with the winds of change: A new doctor. This doctor is different. David London is a psychiatrist (ack!), but also a Functional Medicine MD, trained in Chinese medicine and Buddhist meditation. For two years he quietly listened to my weekly word-dumps without suggesting medication. Instead, he taught me to breathe. And visualize. I learned to visualize comforting space at night, like a cloud around my pain. And it works well enough to let me sleep for a few hours, enough to be highly functional the next day. It's the best I've felt in years, but my Mary Poppins-doctor believes I can feel even better, and he continues to contemplate the puzzle of my health. You see, Dr. London has this theory that we all have an inner bucket where bad stuff is stored. And for some people, the bucket is never filled. But for others, for reasons we may not fully understand, their bucket gets filled to the brim and eventually overflows. And this overflowing muck-bucket causes illness. I immediately envision a steamed lobster with a belly full of green tamale and tell him it's disgusting to think of myself as full of toxic waste! He reassures me it's not because I've done something foolish or wrong. It might even be genetic. And there's a test that can prove it. I ask to have genetic testing and the results show that I am indeed one of the lucky few who has trouble clearing certain toxins. I don't know how to feel about that. I feel both validated and discouraged. Ugh. It sounds like a hopeless predicament and I visualize the possibility of sending myself off in a canoe to disappear over the horizon. But Poppins-doc has other plans. He encourages me to familiarize myself with the pioneering work of research physician Ritchie Shoemaker. Though sometimes deemed a controversial character, Dr. Shoe's abundance of published papers and long list of appearances/testimonies before congress and parliaments are enough to convince me to pay attention to his ideas. That and the fact that he's a really nice guy. Ritchie Shoemaker believes that some people have a genetic haplotype that prevents them from clearing toxins. And over time these toxins build up, and our bodies try to fight their effects in various ways, and some of these ways wreak as much havoc as the toxins themselves. All kinds of crazy stuff can happen -- headaches, sweats, insomnia, chest pressure, foot cramps, ringing ears, aching hips, swollen ankles, shortness of breath, and most debilitating of all -- cognitive dysfunction. Yep. Brain Drain was the big one for me. When I first met with Dr. Shoemaker, he confirmed that cognitive issues are often the last straw for highly functional patients like me. We cope and adapt and carry on, thinking of our body as an obstacle to overcome. But when illness begins to take our mind, we grapple with the possibility that perhaps we are outmatched. No amount of visualizing will get our brains back. He said, \"I'm sure you've been told 'it's all in your head.' Well guess what? It is! And we can heal it.\" Wowza. I've been feeling validated for about two months now. My illness is real and according to the tests ordered by Shoemaker, my results indicate I have Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS). CIRS is a multi-system, multi-symptom illness, not yet recognized by health insurance providers, but increasingly relevant in today's world of bio, chemical and environmental toxin overload. I'm feeling hope that I may have finally found my tribe. Patients like me. It's not a tribe many would choose, but for those of us who have had it thrust upon us, we are grateful to be named and recognized. My road to wellness is still long, but at least now I have a plan. And thanks to Poppins-doc and Dr. Shoe, I may just get my birthday wish in a year or two. ------ Shaler McClure Wrightis fascinated with the mysteries of creative process and the healing power of creativity.

    "data": "Sharon Perfetti Executive Director, Cool Kids Campaign, Towson, Maryland By Val Walker Sharon believes conversation is critical to the health of family life when a child is battling cancer. She has helped to create a comforting, friendly center for families to drop in and talk freely. Sharon is the executive director and one of the co-founders of the Cool Kids Campaign, a nonprofit dedicated to improving the quality of life for children with cancer, and to bringing families together. According to Sharon, families facing childhood cancer spend an average of two years battling the illness, consuming an enormous part of a young child's development, and impacting the development of their siblings as well. Parents carry the burden of not only fighting for their child's recovery, but also of keeping family life as normal as possible. Sharon believes in the importance of creating a space for parents to connect and talk in a relaxed, comforting environment, while staff provide services for the children. Her inspiration to co-found Cool Kids sprang from leading a community effort of thousands of volunteers to build Annie's Playground in Fallston, MD, to memorialize her friend's daughter, Annie Cumpston, and other children who had died too soon. Now soaring past their 10th anniversary, the Cool Kids Campaign serves hundreds of families in the Towson, MD, area, operating a learning/tutoring center for children undergoing cancer treatments, as well as offering support groups for their siblings. Cool Kids provides 250 care packages annually, a newsletter, a drop-in center for families, and organizes many fundraising events. As Executive Director of the Cool Kids Campaign for children with cancer, how vital is the role of conversation in your mission? Sharon: Conversation is critical to the health of family life--especially when we have a child with cancer. From the first day we opened our doors, it was clear to me those parents needed face-to-face conversations with each other. They were eager to talk. Through conversation, in a natural way, parents could develop trusting relationships with each other so they could think out loud, problem-solve or just vent. And beyond the frightening medical aspects to consider, there were logistical, financial and educational needs, as if the emotional toll wasn't big enough. \"How can I manage my child's time away from school during the long term treatment?\" \"How can I handle the needs of my other children during these months or years of treatment?\" \"What will happen if the prognosis gets even worse?\" How did you create an environment conducive to parents starting conversations with each other? Did you provide support groups or classes, or offer counseling sessions? Sharon: We just gave people the space and the level of comfort they needed, putting them at ease, and they started talking naturally. We take care of the children while parents kick back and just talk. As important as support groups, counseling and other resources are for parents, we focus more on providing play activities for the children, or tutoring the children, meeting the needs of the children first. But as parents sit together, watching their children playing and learning, just relaxing, they casually chat and develop solid connections. By allowing the parents some respite from their burdens, they feel free enough to open up and talk about whatever is on their minds. Basically, we give them a break, so they can enjoy the simple pleasures of hanging out with other parents. We don't steer them into a particular conversation or topic--they just finally have the time and place to talk, creating strong bonds. I've observed how this organic, drop-in process is effective for sharing even the most painful feelings and situations, as some parents face anticipatory grief during the palliative care for their child. Sharon, what do you think is really going on when parents are talking to other parents of children coping with cancer? Sharon: First of all, parents are not looking for someone to solve their problems. They want empathy, reassurance, understanding, and certainly kindness. All this comes from a good conversation with another parent going through similar hardships. The magic happens when conversation flows naturally, and the parents are surprised by what comes up--a new perspective, a sense of normalcy, a good laugh, a sudden revelation. Once again, here are the ingredients to creating conversations: Welcoming people heartily, freeing them up by caring for their children for a while, letting them sit back and watch their children play and learn, letting them have another parent right next to them to turn to--and then-- let the conversation begin! What personally motivated you to become an advocate for conversation for the families at Cool Kids? Sharon: It all started before I worked with the Cool Kids Campaign, when I was volunteering for Annie's Playground as their general coordinator. Annie's Playground is a memorial playground for dozens of local children who have died, many of them from cancer. I mostly worked from my home in those early years of building the playground, and family members who I had never met came knocking at my door to drop off checks for the equipment needed for the memorial sites. Quite spontaneously, parents and family members would start sharing their memories of the children--they needed to talk, and of course, nothing could be more profound than the death of a child. As they opened up to me with their stories, I would invite them to sit down in my living room, and they often talked for an hour or two. From so many conversations during those years, I learned the power of listening, and that even if we can never fix something broken or lost in our lives, we can at least share what we've learned and what we've loved. So, a few years later, when the Cool Kids programs developed, I was very much aware that we needed a homelike environment for families to talk. Personally speaking, the whole conversation experience with these families has guided me to teach my own children, now ages 21, 18, and 16, the importance of in-person conversation and good listening. Even in our digital age, there are just too many things in life that can't be fixed, and we need to be able to talk with each other even when we don't have the answers. When we can't get the job we want, or the cure we want, or the results we want, at least we still can enjoy our relationships. Are there new media projects developing from all the conversations over the years between the parents, and with you and your staff? Sharon: We're working on a booklet called You Are Not Alone, a result of the many, many conversations we've had about how families can reach out to each other. Also, from my years with Annie's Playground and with Cool Kids, witnessing how healing it is to continue our stories about our loved ones after a death, I've created a tribute site, The Stories Between. It's designed to memorialize loved ones with our stories, videos, and music. It's a free service for anyone anywhere who'd like to create pages for their loved ones. Thanks so much for your time and thoughts, Sharon. It's rewarding to hear how much you've worked towards reclaiming the role of conversation in the lives of your families--and in your own life.

    "data": "By Alisha Karuvannur-Sandhu Summer is the loneliest season. I thought with age I could escape it, but there I was, alone in a hot not-home, and I was so afraid to fall again, down and down and down. ~ In grade school, summertime brought a big empty house with broken air conditioning. Strict working parents kept me inside, playdates sparse, and most of my time was spent in quietly overwhelming solitude. I ate hot sticky peaches and watchedAmerica's Got Talentand fended off the heaviness that always showed up in slow moments. It felt never-ending, and when escapism failed me, I sat wondering if this was all life had to offer. I thought about God and the afterlife, and how dreadful it must be to go to heaven and have to experience pleasant nothing forever. The loneliness always ended in the fall, though. It was the one thing I could count on, school starting again, my sense of smallness dissipating. Companionship breathed life into my lungs, and I became myself again, studious and motivated and together (as together as a child can be). I left that peach-eating cocoon on the couch to rot; I emerged whole and new and ready for the world ~ When the pandemic hit, despite my best efforts to stay occupied, it wasn't long before I became startlingly aware of how big the world was and how little I felt. The warmth of my bed called to me. The air was balmy, yet I wanted nothing more than to bury myself underneath the comforter and let the heaviness of gravity wash over me, weigh me down until I sunk into my mattress, through the bed, through the floor, down below the dirt beneath my house, down all the way to the center of the Earth. Every night, I would click off my screen after a who-knows-how-long session of scrolling, left with a buzzing sensation in my head. As I sat alone in my bed, I felt a familiar crushing solitude creep into the room.Is it hot in here? Vague unease brewed deep inside my chest. Once they were unlocked, all these uncomfortable sensations seemed to follow me everywhere, sometimes lying dormant but always under the surface. ~ I woke up one morning unable to breathe. I checked the time on my phone. Just past 6am. Inhale. Exhale. There was no use, it was too shallow. How could this happen? I had been so careful. My chest tightened and my heart fluttered. Heaviness reincarnated into something new. I started to feel lightheaded. Surely my blood oxygen levels must have been abysmal. I felt my pulse rapidly speed up. Thump thump thump. My mind raced with questions. Do I go tell Mom? Do I go to the emergency room? What if I gave it to the family? What the fuck have I done? I had to get up and let her know. My father was gone already (he worked upstate and was only home some weekends), but I listened at her door and could hear her getting ready for work. I knocked quietly, then with more urgency. \"Mom?\" I called, my voice cracking. After a few long seconds, she opened the door. \"Why are you up so early?\"\"I think I have COVID.\" \"What? Why?\" \"I'm short of breath.\" \"Don't be ridiculous.\" \"I can't breathe, Mom.\" My face contorted against my will. Fat round teardrops fell out of nowhere, and suddenly I was bawling into her shoulder like a baby, unable to stop.Shhhh, it's okay.My face was caked in tears and snot. I gasped for air, but it was like breathing in a vacuum.You're hyperventilating. You're having a panic attack.I watched her hurry to the kitchen and return with a paper bag. She held it to my face as I heaved in and out. A few days later, my test results came back negative. As my summer continued its descent into malaise, I found refuge in the fact that I would be back in school soon, with classes to keep me busy, friends around me at all times, and bustling city air to cleanse away this steady taste of isolated suburbia. I spent most of the days lying in bed with the blinds shut--sunlight was too bright--scrolling through my phone or simply falling in and out of half-sleep. I reminded myself that fall would come again and revive me, as it always had before. Rebirth was just in my grasp when the stories started coming out. All these kids going off to college only to be packing everything back up four days later. I joked about it with my friends, but the concern was real and growing. Then, one by one, they decided not to come back for the fall. Each housing cancellation was a light going out, until I had only one roommate left. A week before I was to fly back, I got a text from her.I'm sorry, Alisha.The last light fizzled into blackness. I looked out ahead at the dark apartment waiting for me. I thought about staying in California, but I couldn't do it. I had to get out. Change seemed my only hope of becoming myself again. I was going to make it work.~ The dark roots of something insidious were starting to take hold. Just a few days into the start of the fall semester, my senses began failing me. I sat in neurobiosomething listening to the professor speak sounds I couldn't hear. I could feel the words go into my ears, I could feel my brain as it passively watched them float into my skull and spat them right back out, raw and jumbled and unprocessed. I narrowed my eyes at the slides on the projector screen, at the text that surely had to be English. I must have forgotten how to read, the way the letters amounted to gibberish. Day after day, my comprehension diminished. Instead, I became acutely aware of the fluorescent lights humming in the classroom. My head buzzed in unison. Everything was too bright, always. Too hot, too. I shifted my weight back and forth in my chair, tugging at the collar of my shirt and stroking my sternum, my arms, my hair. Swallowing became manual; I compulsively gulped til I forgot how and would choke on my own dry throat. Day after day, the world became increasingly unintelligible. I was consumed by the thought that I was trapped in my seat with no escape. I feared my body would cease to function unless I kept it in check. Breathing was no longer autonomic; I had to shakily force air in and out of my lungs. I pressed two fingers to my neck to make sure I was still alive, that my heart hadn't spontaneously decided to shut off. Dread shrouded my head like a fog, made me deaf and blind, day after day, day after day, I was falling, faster, harder, day after day. Eventually I stopped going to classes. I took up shelter in that big empty apartment. Barely furnished, no air conditioning. I let oppressive heat overtake my body. A proverbial sinking feeling nudged me towards the couch, where I sat watching Zoom lectures, where I ate my paltry meals, where I slept less-than-soundly at night, where I could not fall, only sink, slow and steady. Although I felt barely alive, I found a strange assurance in my deadened state. Familiarity bred affection; I became so well acquainted with solitude that I developed a sense of dependency on it, the only stability in my life. I isolated myself from the world, scarcely communicating with friends or family, avoiding the news, embracing seclusion. Days blurred into each other, dishes piled up and up, the air outside grew frigid. I stayed glued to the cushions through it all, wrapping myself in blankets. Roots gripped me, enveloped my cocoon-bound body. This wasn't how things were supposed to happen. Time after time I had broken free without exertion. Where was my renewal, my sacred rebirth? Now I lay there immobile--a carcass decomposing. Images of my destruction, in endless variations, flashed through my brain like strobe lights. Flesh torn apart. Water rushing into my lungs. Carbon monoxide silently putting me to eternal sleep. Medleys of pills bubbling in my stomach, poison coursing through my veins and shutting down my organs. Jumping off a bridge and into the Charles--one final, irreversible fall. Things got too bright and too hot and too loud and too much one night, and I concluded my only options were to get help or die. I thought of Mom. I wondered how long it would take for her to realize I was gone (she would surely be the first to realize). I wondered who would have to find my decaying remains, who would have to call her to relay my fate. I wondered what she would say at my funeral. I wondered if she would blame herself, if she would pick apart my life trying to find where she went wrong. I dialed her number with tears in my eyes. ~ With effort, heaviness, in all its incarnations, always proves fleeting.

    "data": "By Genevieve Hammond Kidney Donor - MGH, surgery date 10/25/18 This event is called a Healing Story Session, but technically, my story begins with health, not illness. As a prospective kidney donor, the whole point was for me to be as healthy as possible, and I was. But there was something wrong with me that day in January 2018, when I scrolled through Facebook to find my friend and colleague Mike Romano telling us that, having been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, he now found himself asking the \"difficult\" question: was there anyone in his orbit who would be willing to consider donating a kidney to him? What felt difficult to him to ask felt immediately, unquestionably, and profoundly right to me to answer in the affirmative. Because despite having general good health, the right blood type, and two kidneys that had always seemed to function quite well, I did have an affliction that weighed upon me. I believe that my subconscious soul recognized in this kidney journey the possibility of beginning to heal my heart, which had broken just two months before, on November 5, 2017, when I found my mother dead on the floor of her house. In the shock and emptiness I had felt since that day, I nevertheless spied something in the possibility of organ donation that might fill me again with peace. My mother, Yvonne, was diagnosed with cancer in her tonsils in late October of 2016, at age 79, just four months after the death of her husband of nearly 30 years, my stepfather Jim. The year between her diagnosis and her death featured the full array of treatments at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, including both chemotherapy and radiation. Because of the intensity of the course of treatment, she spent several weeks on the cancer floor at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, as well as extended stays at three different rehab facilities. The the treatment period was seven weeks, but because of the severity of its effects, Yvonne was continuously hospitalized or in rehab for more than three months. My brother Henry and I, her only children, spent much of our time with her, at appointments and treatment sessions, in hospitals and nursing homes, so that she wouldn't be alone. I was stunned when I joined her for a chemo session for the first time, as the nurse who was administering the drug arrived wrapped in double layers of gowns to protect herself from even touching the very substance that was about to be dripped into my mother's veins. On another day at the Brigham, a nurse saved her life in what seemed to me to be a major heart event that had nothing to do with the cancer but everything to do with the unendurable pain of her burned-out throat. Even in May, when the oncologist declared her cured of the cancer, she was still stripped her of her ability to eat and the feeding tube that had been installed months before had to remain in place, as she slowly retrained herself to consume food, even when it tasted wrong and metallic and miserable. Growing up in Brookline, Mass., my mother having worked as an administrator at Harvard Medical School and the Brigham for years, it was an article of faith that we were so lucky to live in this part of the country. It was like a talisman, I now see - one of the charms of what I think I thought of as my charmed life. Not perfect, not without sadness or failure or misfortune - but happy underneath it all. The day in November 2016 when Henry and I joined our mother on the Head & Neck floor of the Farber, when Dr. Rabinowitz told her that they had found cancer on her tonsils and adjacent lymph nodes, it was bad. But we were in the place that people came tofrom everywhere in the worldto be treated for these things; this was a place with an entire floor devoted to precisely the kind of cancer my mother had. In the way that the radiation team targeted her cancer within millimeters with their fierce rays, that's how focused these people were on specific types of cancer. What I would learn, of course, is that no matter how targeted the radiation, the physical pain would spread just as malignantly as the disease that was being stopped. In fact, it was the very way that they were focused, each in their own way, that precluded them from being able to see Yvonne as she was, fragile and stoic and terrified and alone in a fundamental way for the first time in more than 30 years. The way different people kept asking the same questions about where she lived and with whom and whether she was married made it clear that no one saw her that way except for Henry and me, and our spouses. That seemed wrong, in a way I couldn't exactly identify, but that I felt in my heart. The events of February 3, 2017 captured this dissonance for me perfectly. It was the last day of eight weeks of 5 days/week of radiation, and at this point she was inpatient at the Brigham's \"Cancer Center for Excellence.\" I had left work early to meet her there and spend some time with her afterwards, and when I arrived, I found her very confused about what was happening to her; not the first time I had encountered her in this state, either a result of the overwhelming pain she was in or as part of the side effects of a Fentanyl patch for that pain. She was in tears and wanted me to go into the treatment room with her - not permitted. Eventually, we were able to reassure her that it was OK and no one was going to hurt her (?!), and she proceeded to the lab. When she came out, one of the two nurses who had followed her case came to say goodbye and asked us to wait a minute before returning to the Brigham. She returned shortly with a bubble gun to fill the area with bubbles in a celebration of the end of the course of radiation. She couldn't have been kinder or had better intentions, and I even took pictures of the three of us; but all I see when I look at it now is a film of smiles over the ocean of my mother's agony, and a kind of willful misunderstanding of that moment in a cancer patient's course of treatment. It gotso much worseafter that point - they hadtoldus that it would, as the effects of the chemicals and burning reverberated through my mother's frail body - but that bubble gun \"celebration\" belied any real grasp of what that would mean for her and for us. So all of this time in medical and medicine-adjacent places left me confused about what the words \"treatment\" and \"cure\" and \"healing\" meant. And even while I was grateful to have these purported world-class facilities available to her, I couldn't help question, as the months went on, whether any of the dozens of people who interacted with her really cared about her in the way that would lead her back to authentic good health. Just like the nurse in radiation, everyone we met, individually, was kind and smart and knew their stuff, but each was only treating an aspect of her illness; and it was all so big and terrifying that I could never find the right way to ask the right question of the right person. I just wanted her to be OK, and when by July she was finally home, living on her own again, I felt like I could breathe and let those questions go. Then I arrived at her house on that November Sunday and found her dead, all those questions ballooned into shrieks of pain and confusion and heartbreak that haunt me still. We'll never know what happened to her, though we suspect an internal bleed following the removal of the feeding tube. Maybe her heart gave out, maybe there were other sequelae to her treatment. All I know is that this was my malady: not just the personal, crushing loss of a mother who offered unconditional love for all of the 54 years we had together, but also the faltering of my belief in these medical practices and practitioners and institutions. This was my frame of mind when I saw Mike's post about his need for a kidney. In the moment, I only really registered two things: I had the correct blood type (O+), and I like to fill out forms. So I hopped on the MGH screening site and filled to my heart's content. I honestly never thought I'd be chosen as a kidney donor; I thought for sure my age would knock me out, or my somewhat overweightness, or a million other things - it seems deeply out-of-this-world to contemplate being an organ donor. Mike and I have known each other for more than ten years, since he joined me at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School - him teaching science, me English. Our fields are different - \"opposites\" in a lot of the ways that many schools operate. But we have had many students in common and I have learned from them of his gifts for inspiring a love of science, its processes and discoveries and possibilities. We have co-advised the school's Student Council and chaperoned proms together. We have served together on union boards, where my urge to placate has balanced against his willingness to engage in the fight. Early in his career, we were two of the final three competitors in a student-run spelling bee and I was crushed when his deep knowledge of fancy Latinate science words took me out. I am in awe for his many gifts, of language and communication in addition to his enthusiasm and curiosity in his chosen field, and I can say now that I've always felt a kind of big-sister affection for him. I will never forget getting the email, just before February vacation in 2018, saying I was a potential match. I was sitting at my desk in my classroom, and it actually did feel like being struck by lightning. I had a sense of being suddenly lifted above of my misery, deposited in a place where death and my grief could recede and the possibilities of life were manifest. After feeling frustrated and sidelined during my mother's treatment and ultimately mystified by her death, it seemed suddenly possible that I could move to the center of a life-saving story. I called Mike right away in Washington, where he was spending a sabbatical year as an Einstein Fellow working at NASA. It never occurred to me not to tell him that I was a possible match, in case I might have wanted to change my mind, because I knew, without knowing why, that there was never a question of changing my mind. I was a little bit giddy when I called to let him know that I was a \"green light\" candidate, meaning that I would be scheduled for the proverbial battery of tests before learning whether I could actually donate or not. I think we were both stunned that after a literal worldwide response to his initial post, his potential donor could be just down the hall in the west wing of the high school. He assured me that his need for a new kidney was urgent in the \"within 6-8 months\" sense, and not the \"next week during February vacation\" sense, and I relaxed, for a while. Every step of the testing held an odd kind of thrill for me. I can now see that the whole process was a mirror image of my experience with my mother, which certainly contributed to that feeling. Because the donor has their own team of professionals, separate from the recipient's team, I was the focus of attention of a group of people dedicated to one goal: making sure I was fit for a major surgery and its aftermath. In a way, they had the same intensity of focus as the oncologists and radiologists who had treated my mother, but the expertise of each member of the team seemed to me to be integrated instead of exclusive. I met with my nurse, Kelly, and my social worker, Judy, and each of them took great pains and time to make sure I knew what to expect, and to learn about me and my story. Even parts of my life outside the Mass. General were folded into the process: when I met with the psychiatrist on the team, and I told him that I was talking with my own therapist about the possibility of transplant, he asked if I would allow him to speak with her. I agreed, and even felt buoyed by the idea that he was taking such care. I did a series of respiratory tests to determine my lung capacity because I smoked for 18 years - though I quit nearly 20 years ago. It felt as though I started the process feeling mildly good about my own health and by the time I got to surgery on October 25, I felt like a superwoman. I should talk here about what passed between me and Mike in all this time. The testing began in March of 2018, and proceeded through the end of June. I checked in with Mike periodically, though we were both incredibly busy and several states apart at the time. And as I've said, we aren't friends, as such - we don't hang out, we don't socialize. We're close as colleagues, but if I eventually gave him my kidney, it would not be because of our deep personal bond. I think it was something that confused some people when I first started talking about the possibility of organ donation. When I said that the possible recipient wasn't a relative or close friend, I felt mystification and even concern start to emanate. I couldn't really explain it myself, this bubbling elation I felt whenever I imagined my nurse Kelly telling me that we were a \"go\" for donation. I just knew that I didn't want to let it go. My social worker Judy raised this question, in reverse, during the testing period. We talked about how I would feel if I got a \"no\" from Kelly, and what I would do to manage that feeling; how I would even prepare for the call itself, when it came, regardless of the verdict. I told her I would be devastated if I couldn't donate, though in truth, this felt like it was more about me than about Michael. I had seen the Facebook response, I knew how much he meant to so many people. I couldn't imagine that another donor couldn't be found. When I examined this potential \"no,\" I simply felt as if something would be taken from me - ironic, since that \"no\" would actually mean I would get to keep something, a kidney. I couldn't explain it, and I just hoped I didn't sound too zealous to be a good donor. We also agreed that if I saw Kelly's name on an incoming call, I should sit down to take it. And then, there it was: Kelly called me in June, after the kidney team had met, just as she said she would. I took a seat, as I had promised Judy I would. And as you know, it was a \"yes.\" The relief, the elation, the surrealness, they all exploded in me. Kelly asked if I wanted to be the one to tell Mike, and to be able to do that felt like another gift. We agreed that Mike and I would start to think about potential surgery dates, after she said what felt like the weirdest thing: \"We usually do these transplant surgeries on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so keep that in mind when picking dates.\" The bigness of my feelings compared with the everydayness of that statement still makes me laugh. I texted Mike to see if he was free, and asked him to call me if he was. I don't remember the exact words that passed between us, but it was a very good vibe on that line from Needham to Washington DC. We didn't talk long, in the end, past deciding that we would start looking at dates (Tuesdays & Thursdays!) as he wrapped up at NASA and I proceeded into summer travels. I knew that Mike would be busy wrapping up his year in DC and moving back to Cambridge in late July/early August. I also knew that this surgery, and its aftermath, were probably much heavier for him to contemplate than they were for me. I was desperate for my kidney to work for him, but even if it didn't, I would come out of the surgery relatively unscathed. He had many more reasons to hesitate, while I felt nothing but full-steam-ahead. As August ticked along and we hadn't picked a date yet, I started to worry that he might not want to go through with it, or that he might prefer a donation from a stranger rather than being tied to me in this way for the rest of his life. Finally, on August 27, I wrote Mike an email, which included the following: \"The only other thing is to tell you how profoundly happy this process makes me - and how incredibly lucky I feel to be able to do this with you. I don't know if that sounds ridiculously saccharine and hard to believe, but I swear to you it's the whole, unmitigated truth. It makes me happy to think I'll have a connection to you in this way, but I don't want you to think that possession of one of my kidneys will lead to any possessive stalking on my part; once it's yours, it's all yours, and if you want to take it around the world on a binge when you turn 40, have at it!\" I read this now, and the intensity of how much I wanted this to work suffuses me again. I literally could not wait to give something of myself, of my own body, and I felt lucky at the prospect of an entirely voluntary, deeply invasive surgical procedure. I couldn't explain it then any better than I did - \"take my kidney for a joyride!\" - but as I'm writing this piece, it's starting to come into greater focus. Mike didn't reply to that email, and he didn't have to; it was enough that I had made my intentions clear. Soon after, we texted some possibilities back and forth - as we like to say, \"like you'd schedule a coffee date\" - and eventually settled on Thursday, October 25. When that day came, I felt not one instant of pain or fear, but instead a kind of stillness and peace. From my bed in the pre-op unit, I could see the electronic board listing various surgeries; in the medical shows on TV, it's a messy whiteboard, but this was a beautifully intelligent screen. I realized that all the surgeries were inching to the left along a timeline. Even without my distance glasses, I could just make out \"kidney transplant\" on the board, and I zeroed in on that entry until it met its destination time of 10 a.m. I also remember thinking, it's a good thing I started taking anti-anxiety medication 20 years ago, in preparation for this very moment, which back then would have been suffused with dread, instead of the peaceful anticipation of today. If I leave you with anything today, let it be an endorsement for good mental health care. Our surgeries having crossed the timeline, it was time to go; I was wheeled to the very, very bright operating room, told that the mask would smell like a beach ball, start to count backwards, and I'm out. But two seconds later, I'm back. If you've never had surgery - as I never had - you should be aware that it's not like sleeping. There are no dreams, there's no sense of any time passing at all. It seems quite inconceivable that anything could have happened in the few seconds you were out. But of course, it wasn't seconds, it was hours, at least four hours, and someone is pushing their knuckles into my chest to wake me up, and all I remember saying as I opened my eyes was, \"Did it work? Is it working?\" I needed to know if my kidney was functioning inside Mike, and they told me right away that it was. Hallelujah! I had no more words, but I was happy to be rolled to a room on the same floor where Mike would eventually also arrive, though his surgery would take longer than mine. People want to know about everything I had to \"go through,\" the restrictions I must have had, or still have, on what I eat or drink, on whether I feel different being down a kidney. But the truth is, from the very first hours of recovery, it's just not that big a deal. This might have been influenced by the fact that my roommate for most of my two night stay at the Mass. General was a heart transplant recipient with multiple woes, so my situation truly paled in comparison. I was uncomfortable, to be sure - the particulars of expelling the gas used to inflate my belly so that Dr. Dageforde could reach in with her exquisitely small hands through the incision around my belly button to extract my left kidney - I'll leave them to your imagination. I couldn't roll onto either side, and lying on your back is a drag after a while. But nothing about my diet has changed, nothing about the way my body functions has changed, and there was never a moment from when I was awoken that I wasn't in awe, in relief, in joy. My husband Dan, no fan of hospitals, stayed with me, and my brother Henry and sister-in-law Mimi arrived from the waiting area where it turned out that they had met and bonded with Karen and Angelo, Mike's parents. It was, in the most elemental and profound way, all good. And here we are now, almost exactly seven months to the day from that day. Whenever someone comments on what I did, the only thing I can ever say is how lucky I feel to have been able to do it. I've said it reflexively and for a long time I thought it was because I got to be the person who makes such a difference in the life of another person. But in telling this story, I've been pushed to unpack what I really meant by that, at first just to myself and now to all of you. And of course, you've probably guessed by now what it turns out I meant: the luckiest thing about this adventure was that it came at the exact moment when I needed to be rescued from the very worst reality by the very best possibility. I needed to be able to focus on my body and what it was capable of so that I could get out of my head and even my heart and the sadness by which both were bound. Being one of about 65 living donors in 2018 at the Mass. General was the opposite in every way of being one of thousands of patients at the Dana Farber, which was Yvonne's plight. In a conversation with Annie Brewster, when I was wrestling with this story, she drew my attention to something that's a little bit raw, but I can't get the image out of my head: I have told you that we think that the removal of Yvonne's feeding tube might have contributed to her death. It's a common enough procedure, the tube being yanked out a little abruptly - as she described it to us that night - and almost never dangerous. And yet there she was, the next day, dead on the floor. I told this to Annie, and after a pause, she pointed out that I also had something removed from my body - but with care, and thought, and intention. And not only am I still here to tell the story, but much, much more importantly, so is Michael.",

    "data": "An interview with Dhruv Khullar,M.D., M.P.P. By Val Walker Could there be anything more frightening than going to a hospital alone for surgery, knowing that no one will be by your side when you wake up afterwards? What if you have no one to turn to for help when you become seriously ill? As a former rehabilitation case manager, I witnessed too many patients without social support. Too often I scrambled to contact any possible friends or relatives to help, and came up short with utterly no one available. I turned to social science research to better understand why people were so isolated. An alarming AARP study in 2012 on social isolation highlighted formidable barriers to social support: Living alone (Nearly 40% of adults over 65 are living alone.) Mobility or sensory impairment Major life transitions/losses. Socioeconomic status (low income, limited resources). Location (rural, unsafe or inaccessible neighborhoods) Being a caregiver for someone with a major impairment. Moreover, the study revealed that full-time caregivers are mostly women who are often alone without support while struggling to take care of their own health care needs. The AARP study convinced me that being socially isolated is most often not a choice. Many societal and economic forces prevent us from being able to count on each other for support. Today we're more likely to find ourselves alone in a hospital regardless of how much or how little we've invested in our relationships. Indeed, in 2012, I found myself alone, stranded in a hospital bed after my hysterectomy because my friend failed to show up as planned. I had no one to take me home, and no one to check in on me during my first days after my surgery. I had made firm arrangements, but people just did not come through at the last minute. This shocking experience opened my eyes to how alone and stranded any of us can be. Recently I read a New York Times article titled How Social Isolation is Killing Us by Dhruv Khullar, MD, who works at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Khullar's compassionate view of his socially isolated patients sparked my interest in contacting him for an interview. Annie Brewster and I were thrilled when he responded to our invitation and agreed to talk with us. You wrote a powerful piece for the New York Times called How Social Isolation is Killing Us. As a doctor at Mass General Hospital, do you personally see an increase in socially isolated patients? Dhruv Khullar: All the time--every day, I see real life evidence of how isolated people are. And social isolation is increasing. Lots of interesting statistics are out there about social isolation, but it's my personal experience that motivated me to write more about this problem. I see elderly as well as younger patients coping with a lack of social support. We're now living in a world of smaller families, and we often lack the extended support that larger families once provided. I see older patients living without their core group of support after many of their loved ones have passed away. And many younger people are dealing with the stigma of addiction or mental health issues, so their social support has been thinning out. In our digital age, we can have 1000 friends on Facebook, but who is going to show up at the hospital for us? Who is really there in our support system? Many connections we have through social media are only secondary supports, not the one or two people we can really count on in a crisis. What can doctors do to help socially isolated patients? Dhruv Khullar: I think it's in the doctor's purview to ask about the social needs of our patients. Doctors have an important opportunity to screen for social isolation just by asking a couple of questions. We can identify isolated patients by asking simple, concrete questions such as \"Who do you have to talk to about your surgery?\" Or \"Is there someone to take care of you when you go home?\" Just two or three basic questions can make a difference. Also, practical, care-based questions are less likely to be threatening for a patient. Instead of starting with psychological issues (\"Are you feeling lonely?\") we can ask, \"Is someone coming by to see you today?\" And once we have identified a patient who lacks social support, we can make a referral to a social worker, chaplain or hospital volunteer. They are a crucial part of the team. Healthcare has become so complex, it's better to deliver care in a team-based setting, especially for a patient who has no one to rely on. Though we as doctors can play a vital role in identifying socially isolated patients, we need to alert our team so these patients get connected to the best services that meet their needs. What you said makes so much sense. It does seem natural that a doctor would ask questions about who is caring for you--who is there for you. And further, I'm wondering this: If your doctor is genuinely concerned that you don't have anyone there for you, could these questions encourage you to talk openly about your lack of support? Dhruv Khullar: Yes, I believe asking simple, care-based questions can make it easier for patients to have an honest conversation about their need for more support. And this conversation could alleviate some of the shame and distress about being alone without support. Conversations, even brief talks with doctors, have a way of normalizing what has felt uniquely embarrassing or shameful. A patient might not feel so alone when their doctor emphasizes that social isolation is a common problem. You got me thinking about the stigma in our society that makes it so difficult to speak up if we lack social support, and are truly alone. We don't want to appear \"needy.\" What do we do if we really don't have people to turn to when we must have surgery, or find ourselves seriously ill? Isn't talking about being alone and needing help a hard conversation to have? Dhruv Khullar: Conversations can start with a doctor or healthcare provider, even if we are too ashamed to discuss our lack of support with someone else. Once the conversation has started, patients may be able to face their need for support with less shame and more action. Once again, care-based, concrete questions can help us speak openly, and begin planning our care, including making referrals for the support that is needed. We need to have more conversations about social isolation. The more candid the better. Hopefully we will find the courage to ask, \"Will you be there for me?\" And we will keep talking until we know who we can count on. Besides making referrals to hospital social workers, chaplains or volunteers, is there a particular resource that you find helpful when you identify a socially isolated patient? Dhruv Khullar: I highly recommend the Health Leads program. This service is available in many hospitals in Massachusetts and other areas of the country. It can help connect patients to services they need, with links to community resources. I use it very often. When interacting with a patient who is alone and lacking support, what do you say or do to put them at ease? Dhruv Khullar: In the busyness of the hospital what sometimes gets lost is the human connection. One patient I remember was dying alone, without any loved ones around. At those times, it's important just to listen. So I listened to whatever he wanted to talk about. Being present was as valuable as anything else I could do. In my experience, even in just a few minutes, there are moments for deep connection. If we make the time, we can deeply and honestly communicate about what's most important. I'm really moved by your words. Thank you so very much for your generosity and insight, Dr. Khullar. And I'm so grateful that you're encouraging people to talk more about this problem of social isolation. You have validated for me just how vital it is to have honest, realistic conversations when we need to ask others to help us. Dhruv Khullar: Thank you, it was a pleasure to talk with you today.

    "data": "I am 16 years old, desperately clinging on to the last few weeks of summer before my junior year of high school. The days are long and sticky with humidity, and I mostly spend them sequestered in my room, lulled into midday naps by the hum of air conditioning. In the past few years, I've sunk deep into the comforts of my room, only emerging to run and catch the bus each morning. There I am alone, and maybe that's preferable to being with you. I don't go out with you and your friends anymore. Not to eat ice cream from the shop in town or sit in someone's basement and drink. Each time you do see me you urge me to come out sometime. You say I would be less depressed if I did. I want so badly for you to be right. My phone lights up, and I flinch when I see your name. When I was younger (much younger), the sight might have been a welcome one, but not anymore. By this point I know what you are capable of. This night's incident would not be the first, nor the last. You want to meet for dinner. I stare blankly at the time. It's 10:00 pm. I ate hours ago, and I tell you so, but you just got off work and you're hungry. I type out a resoundingno thanks, see you when school starts,but I hesitate. Maybe you're right. Maybe if I go out I'll be happier. I'm so desperate to lessen the heavy weight that sits on my chest each day that it outweighs the trepidation I feel towards you. So I tell you I'm not hungry, but I'll keep you company. You say we can go to the pizza place around the corner. I scurry out of my house, meeting you halfway up the street. I don't want you coming to my house, even just to stand on the porch. Something about your presence on my doorstep would feel like a stain, a contamination. I don't want my parents seeing you either. Irrationally, I worry they could look in your eyes and see what you've done. As we begin to walk you tell me you have no money. That strikes me as strange, seeing as you're the one who wanted dinner. But I say nothing. My ability to question, to protest, has mysteriously evaporated. As we near the pizza place, I see the windows are dark, the chairs placed upside down on the tables. They're closed, and they have been for a while. That seems odd, too, seeing as you must have walked by on your way to meet me. You barely even spare it a glance, walking straight past. You suggest we go to the park. My legs betray the dread that's made a home in my body and I follow dutifully. That's what we're supposed to do, right? Be compliant? But the tiny grains of unease prick at the nape of my neck, urging me to turn around. I suppose those were my instincts, which I excel at ignoring. So I agree, because that's what I'm good at. Our town is dark and deserted, so I shouldn't be surprised when the park is too. The sole inhabitant is a man crouched low on a bench, fumbling with a cigarette. He asks you for a light but you have none, so you apologize as we descend into the playground. I haven't been here since I was a little kid. It's different now. They've updated the equipment, the plastic slides bright and shiny, even in the darkness. You take off your apron and fold it neatly on a swing. You've been washing dishes all day. You start to tell me a story as I stand there, my feet shuffling in the wood chips. You were texting your friend at work all day talking about how horny you were. How all you wanted was a blowjob. He said he could hook you up with someone but you said no. I don't know how I'm supposed to respond to this, but a cool girl wouldn't bat an eye at this kind of talk, so I say nothing, the ghostly light of the street lamps illuminating your face. You keep peeking at me, gauging my expression. This feels like a test so I try to look as nonchalant as possible. I don't think it works, and you look away again. Then you're fumbling with your belt, and the metal of the buckle is like wind chimes but also fills me with dread. You apologize, that same genuinely sorry tone you used when you didn't have a lighter for that man, but you justhaveto take a piss. I stare anywhere but at you as you piss against some poor tree. Then I go and sit at the top of the slide, wondering why you would do that. Now I know you wanted an excuse to take your dick out. You clamber up the slide to sit near me, our legs touching. I feel a sense of real revulsion. And then I see you didn't put it away, and that image burns into my brain like hot metal on flesh. You're still talking because that's what you know how to do best, and the seal on my mouth breaks open, the words tumbling out like water:my dad wants me home i need to go home he's texting me i have to leave i'm sorry-- But you're calm, like you expected this resistance, and you insist that we have plenty of time. There's enough time (for what?) before I have to leave. You lay across my lap, and my back reflexively presses against the bars until it's painful. I'm a statue made of stone and you are the bird shit that covers it. You tell me toguide my hand towards itbut I don't want to and I don't know how to and even if I wanted to say that I couldn't anyway. A list of excuses tumbles out of my mouth and you deflect each one deftly like a star athlete. My heart is pounding so hard I feel like you must be able to hear it, you're so close to me. I stare down at you, trying to focus on your face instead of everything else, and childishly, I wonder if you will kiss me. Not because I want you to, but because some part of me wants to be the object of someone's boyhood crush. I wanted a single rose because a dozen was too expensive and cheap chocolates from the grocery store and a tacky heart shaped necklace from the mall. This is not how high school relationships are supposed to happen. I don't even like you in that way, but you seem to want me and I wishsomeonewould but not likethis. I make a final plea,I need to leave, and you press your full body weight into my lap, murmuring,you can't leave if I do this.Fruitlessly, I try to stand up, but your weight impedes me completely. I can't get up, as much as I try, struggling with the effort. I resign myself to my fate, the task ahead of me that you've assigned, but I'm paralyzed. I stare back blankly as you look up at me, expectation clear in your eyes. Finally you sigh, annoyed, buckling your pants back up and standing. I scramble up, murmuring apologies (for what?) and jumping back down into the wood chips, my knees smarting in pain at the rough landing. You say you'll walk me home because it's late, which I find ironic, because who do I need to be protected from but you? Of course, I acquiesce, and we walk together, the silence heavy. My mind is blank. I just want to be alone again. Alone can be lonely but it doesn't hurt me like you do. You pluck a leaf from a nearby plant, your fingers punching holes in its veiny surface like two eyes. As we reach my street you hand it to me wordlessly, telling me you'll see me at school in a few weeks. You walk away, hands shoved deep in your pockets, and the fluorescent glow of the streetlamps makes the world look like a movie set at nighttime turned artificially into day. I twist the leaf in my hands and walk the rest of the way home alone. My parents are sitting in the living room like always. I walk straight up the stairs silently, taking out my diary and sitting on my bed. I don't remember what I wrote, but afterwards I took that leaf and pasted it into the pages. I wonder if it's brown and crumbling now, or if the scotch tape has kept it intact, green and smooth, chlorophyll staining the pages and the tips of my fingers.

    "data": "I'm not a diabetic, I'm a person with diabetes. I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 1993. I thought my year of exhaustion, weight loss and crazy mood swings were the result of a bad marriage and the stress of parenting 2 active boys, ages 3 and 6. But for some reason, that day, after drinking my umteenth glass of water which did nothing to quench my thirst, I stopped and thought about the symptoms I'd been living with for over a year that suddenly seemed to coalesce in a moment. I called the doctor and described my symptoms. \"Do you think I have diabetes?\" No one was going to tell me that over the phone. I went in for a test and 24 hours later I had a diagnosis: Type 1 diabetes. A week later, I was staring at a much-xeroxed piece of paper titled Diabetic Diet with boxes and columns to fill in: food item on the left, amount in ounces and cups on the right. There were other pieces of paper: Diabetic Eating Guidelines and Diabetic Food List. The diagnosis was traumatic enough, but these guidelines and sample diets shrank my world into one miserable, tunnel-visioned focus. I was a diabetic-walkers, blindness and kidney failure loomed on the horizon. But I followed the guidelines and life came into balance. I gained weight, which was good though initially unappreciated. After months of uncontrolled high blood sugars, I had lost quite a bit of weight from an already thin frame. A few months before my diagnosis, friends began saying, \"You look gaunt. Are you OK?\" They said \"gaunt\" but I heard \"thin,\" another reason it took me so long to see a doctor. I was eating what I wanted and loosing weight-how could this be a problem? But of course it was. In those initial months I faithfully followed the Diabetic Diet. I ate the suggested amount of food from the suggested food groups and took the suggested amount of insulin to cover the carbs I was faithfully counting. One night, after gobbling down half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to cover plummeting blood sugars (I still had no idea how much to eat to offset a low), I was hit by a bolt of insight. I said to myself, \"I'm going to fit diabetes into my life not the other way around.\" In other words, I would define what I ate and when. I would define how I lived my life, not diabetes. It's taken years to develop healthy self-care practices. I'm not rigid but I have routines-routines I created myself not routines imposed upon me. I've come to believe wellness has 3 interactive practices: pursuit of knowledge about the condition, a creativity practice, and a mindfulness practice (or some kind of spiritual practice). The word \"practice\" is used deliberately to mean an activity that is part of life, essential to life and life affirming. My blood sugar control can still be erratic and difficult at times. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed, irritated and discouraged. Feelings can't be avoided but they can be handled with skill and kindness. Creative, meditative practices have encouraged me to take care of myself with kindness and compassion, using knowledge, creativity and mindfulness. There are no quick fixes. Sometimes situations turn around rapidly after a diagnosis but deep and lasting change is the work of a lifetime. Words are powerful. I may be dealing with a condition or illness but I am nottheillness or the condition. The word \"diabetic\" defines me as a disease. I'm not. Sometimes groups or individuals claim a noun or adjective as a way to re-claim power, but I'd rather nix labels altogether. I actively explore the question, \"what does it mean to be truly healthy?\" Advances in technology, nutrition and exercise are important, but I want creativity and empathy at the center of my life. I'm a public health professional, health advocate, editor, writer, artist, parent, and so much more. I also happen to have type 1 diabetes. That perspective has deeply affected how I take care of myself and interact with others. About Valerie: Valerie has lived well with T2 diabetes for 23+ years. She credits a mindfulness meditation practice, access to health care, healthy food and exercise, a circle of supportive friends/family, her creative pursuits in visual arts/writing-and luck-to being complication free so far. She works in community health, and trained as a diabetes lifestyle coach. She believes both clientsandproviders would benefit from narrative medicine practice in the healthcare system.",

    "data": "By Dr. Annie Brewster and Leah Meyer More than a decade ago, Colleen Lum was diagnosed with Stage 3 ovarian cancer. Her children, Kyle and Kiara, were 11 and 8 years old at the time. A few months ago, after battling the disease for 13 years, Lum, who lives with her husband and family in Hopedale, Massachusetts, decided to end treatment. Today, at age 56, her health has further declined, according to her daughter. Lum is no longer eating or drinking much. And she's very, very tired. Through it all, though, she's been clear-eyed about her illness. \"We've always been straightforward and honest,\" Lum said during an extensive interview in June. The kids \"get the facts and the truth and it's not 'Mommy has a tummy ache.' No, 'Mommy has cancer.' \" Lum added: \"I was a good parent before cancer, but cancer made me a better parent, because you don't have time to postpone.\" Listen to Lum and her daughter Kiara share their stories here: Ovarian canceris an insidious disease, often asymptomatic until it is quite advanced, resulting in five-year survival rates of under 50 percent. Lum has beaten the odds and navigated an onslaught of difficult decisions with resilience and a keen sense of her priorities. \"You can talk about sex and drugs and alcohol with your kids because you don't have time to postpone those conversations,\" Lum said. \"Nobody's guaranteed tomorrow. And cancer makes that very relevant. When you can sit and talk to your children about your death, everything else becomes easy.\" Four years ago, Lum refused to participate in a clinical trial that would have required her to spend several months away from home and apart from her kids. When her physician implored her to enter the trial, saying it was his job to keep her alive, she replied, \"Well, it's my job to be a mother.\" Lum knows that she won't be around to see her 21-year-old daughter graduate from college -- and it's the thought of missing those major life events that saddens her most. \"It's not the dying that upsets me,\" she said. \"It's the milestones in your children's lives you're gonna miss. Seeing them walk down the aisle or seeing them have babies.\" Still, she's happy and proud she got to be a mother for so long. \"My miracle isn't that I walk out of here and I get cured. My miracle is that I got 13 years of a Stage 3C diagnosis and I watched an 8-year old and an 11-year old turn into a 21-year-old and a 24-year-old. The biggest thing here is perspective.\" After years of intrusive treatment, harsh side effects and approximately 160 rounds of chemotherapy, Lum knew in April that it was time to stop. Her body had had enough. To those who insist she must keep fighting, she said: \"So many people want to jump back into denial and pretend ... that this isn't happening. If you're coming along for the ride, you're getting in my boat, and my boat is reality.\" Now, with death approaching, Lum is grateful to know that not much has been left unsaid. And she spends time envisioning her death: I hope I die with grace and dignity, which I probably will, and a few swear words. It's one thing I've got as cancer's gone on -- I've maintained my filthy little mouth and my few favorite swear words. I wanna have the best quality of life for whatever days we have, and then it's like, I don't know what this whole dying stuff is gonna involve. I hope it's not painful, I hope it's peaceful. I hope I can die at home. But I don't know what it looks like. If I got to call the shots, I'd get to hang around in bed and talk to the very last frickin' minute. And kinda joke and go, 'Hey, it's time to go.' And I say goodbye, and I'd walk out peacefully. But as with cancer and most things, I don't know how much of a choice I get in that. Lum wants to go out on her terms. \"No ventilators or feeding tubes in this body,\" she said. While she accepts that she may not be able to control many things that happen at this point, she wants to control the things she can, and she has spelled it out clearly for her family. For instance: If she is in a coma, she says it's OK to send her to the hospital or hospice. She has chosen a casket, and wants it to be open. She's lined up a caterer for the reception. In our society we are notoriously bad attalking about death. It wasn't until this year that Medicare finally began reimbursing forend-of-life conversationsbetween patient and doctor. In one of the countless conversations Lum has had over the years, she imagines death as a continuation of life, but different: \"What if [it's] nothing but two little hills, and there's a bridge? And you're just leaving one world to go to another ... and it's really something very simple?\" Dr. Annie Brewster, a Boston internist and founder of the Health Story Collaborative, is a regular contributor to CommonHealth.

    "data": "When I was five, I wouldn't let a single person near my hair. My mother had to go out and buy me an expensive bristle brush designed for sensitive scalps. She gave me a peek at it in the car as we drove home. \"It's a magic brush,\" she told me. \"A magitch brush,\" my dad would correct with a wink. Still, hair-brushing time always filled me with dread. In a sudden burst of toddler witticism, I compared the process to airplanes flying into the back of my head. My mother and my nanny Marcy had to get creative. In a particularly successful method, I would wrap my arms around the hairbrusher in question and holler into her shirt as she teased out the snarls. In another approach, I would flip my head upside down and stand with the blood rushing to the tips of my ears as my tangles were torn apart. My dad lacked the courage to even try. On the mornings he was in charge of my hair, he spent half an hour gingerly skimming the brush somewhere over my head, leaving a knot hidden at the nape of my neck. My mother lost her hair twice. Every morning, she would wake up to another nest on her pillow, her hope to be spared shattered like broken eggshells. I was too young to grasp the gravity of this grief. I wrote her a poem as a peace offering, and then cut off my own hair to my shoulders three times. And while she fretted over her scarves, I admired them. She picked the most beautiful colors: blue with white-lined diamonds, swirls of autumn painted with the browns and reds of dying leaves, lilac stained with deep purples. When her hair grew back the first time, it arrived in curls. My mother taught herself to tame it with her hair dryer and various brushes, the scariest of which I dubbed the Red Brush. On weekday mornings in the winter, I would wake up to a pitch black sky and the distant croak of crows. I'd burrow under my blankets, listening to the sound of running water from down the hall. The house was dark but for the soft light from the bathroom, and it was a comfort knowing someone else was up, that she would soon raise the heat, flick on the lights, and sing me awake. It was a comfort knowing that my mother was standing in front of the steamy mirror, wrapped in a towel and curling her bangs, playing with her hair until cancer skulked away, defeated. I taught myself to braid after she died. She had showed me the basics - three pieces, weave under, over, under again - but I had never mastered it on my own. Even ponytails were beyond my ability. I spent ages in front of the mirror each morning, screaming in frustration. I worked at it until my scalp groaned in pain. Caring about the inconsequential was my means of survival. But now when I pull at my hair, I don't worry about it being perfect. Instead, I remember the way my mother twirled her finger around the wisps of my hair when she told me that she loved the way they curled. On those mornings when we were running late and my hair was in no state to make its daily appearance, my mother would wash it in the kitchen sink. She'd rest a towel behind my neck and tell me to lean back, the tips of my hair dangling near the drain. I can still feel her fingers on my head as they traced rhythmic circles from one side to the other. I can still hear the squeak of air as she squeezed the shampoo bottle and made fireworks of soap bubbles float around us. Anna McLoud Gibbs is a freshman at Harvard College.

    "data": "Segment 11 in our seriesSoul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill by Shaler McClure Wright Introduction You're listening to episode eleven of Soul Chronicles, offering a soulful perspective on how to navigate the unique challenges of living with ongoing health conditions. Special thanks to Health Story Collaborative for hosting this monthly audio column. My name is Shaler McClure Wright and I'm a writer/creative living with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. Today I'd like to tell you the story of how illness led me to become a more soulful person. I think of soulfulness as a spiritual orientation to life, but not as belonging to a specific religion. A soulful outlook facilitates meaning and connection--with people, animals, and nature. And it helps us make better choices by providing new frames of reference. A soulful approach to life can also lead us to reconsider forgotten lessons from the past and help us receive wisdom from our ancestors. And over time, with practice and contemplation, we may just become wiser ourselves. For me, deepening into soulfulness has been a gradual process, like foliage deepening in color with the change of seasons. Mother Nature has been a patient and generous guide to my soulful education. But she wasn't the catalyst for it; illness was. It took a one-two punch of medical adversity to open me to a perspective of possibilities beyond the limited vision of my youth. Within the first few months of the year 2000, I was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer and a pituitary tumor. For the first time in my life I could not simply take health for granted. I was humbled, but it would take another fourteen years--and a different threshold of physical discomfort--before I would fully embrace a soulful way of life. I'm not sure why it took me so long. Perhaps I was in denial, or wanted to believe in magical remission, or maybe my prognosis just wasn't dire enough to prompt immediate change. After all, my life wasn't in danger and the cancer and tumor weren't painful. But the treatment was. There were invasive surgical procedures, medications with adverse effects, and extending uncertainties of outcome--looong extensions. As treatments dragged on for more than a decade, it became clear these invaders weren't going away on their own. And once I realized they had become an integral part of me, I became increasingly impatient and anxious. My world grew smaller and I felt disconnected from my own body. I was sinking into despair. I felt trapped in a perpetual state of not-knowing--of wanting answers and guarantees, while at the same time knowing there were none. The truth, as I saw it, was simple: my body had betrayed me. My world had become harsh and dehumanizing, and I wanted to soften the confines of my health reality, but didn't know how (to). So I asked my doctors for help. They decided improving my sleep would be a good first step, and prescribed a sedative called klonopin. And voila, it worked! But--and I'll bet some of you already know what I'm about to say--I kept needing more as my tolerance increased. Xanax was added for 'breakthrough anxiety' and within a few years I was taking enough of each to subdue a wild stallion. Eventually my tumor was shrunk and cancer removed, but I was left with an unexpected problem that turned out to be more painful--and wrought more havoc on my body--than the cancer or tumor (had). I'd become addicted to benzodiazepines. And when it was time to stop taking them, I discovered I was one of the unlucky patients who'd have an unforgettably rough experience. Within 48 hours of discontinuation, my body had a horrific reaction--inner tremors; cramping muscles, a non-stop sense of spinning every time I stood up; ringing ears, full-body jolts, shakes and sweats, buckling knees and ankles, extreme sensitivity to sound and light, and crippling insomnia--and having all this to deal with, I knew it would be impossible to 'just stop.' I would have to reduce my dose in very small increments, if I could do it at all. And I truly had no idea if I would succeed. That was the moment--when I faced a foreseeable future of micro steps forward with incapacitating discomfort accompanying each (step)--I began to deepen into soulfuness. I was prompted--no, make that 'kicked in the butt'-- by constant physical pain I simply could not ignore. My life was held hostage by tiny blue and white pills. So, fourteen years after my cancer and tumor diagnoses, I had finally reached my personal threshold for pain--not from malignancy, but from anxiety pills--and was left with no choice but to slowly taper my dose over the course of a very long year, all the while barely being able to function. My thirteen-month path to benzo freedom was the hardest path I've ever followed. To make things worse, I appeared normal. The drugs' relentless assaults on my body were mostly invisible. So even though my friends and family wanted to be supportive, it was very hard for them to understand. I needed to find a context for my experience that made it easier to grasp, and a way to articulate it that others could recognize. To my surprise, that context would emerge from observing nature, and describing what I saw with soulful language. By calling attention to the parallels between my experience with illness and the images I found in nature, I could help others understand what I was going through. I guess you could say soulfulness came to me as a series of impressions gathered from nature one image at a time. I'd like to tell you about the first image that stood out to me because it remains one of the strongest: I remember dragging myself downstairs to the breakfast nook one sleepless morning and slumping into a wooden chair by the window. My husband had hung a red hummingbird feeder on a branch of the lilac bush just outside, and there were four ruby-throated beauties darting between limbs as they took turns hovering for sips of sugar water. I could see their hearts thumping as their feathers spread and contracted. The sunlight reflected their colorful energy and I could feel their warm glow penetrate through the glass. Oh how I wanted to go outside and join them! I wanted to stretch out my finger and become their safe little perch between sips. But my world would start spinning every time I tried to stand, and my hand was shaking too much to be of any use to them. So I just sat there, and marveled. I marveled at their iridescent green breasts and knitting-needle beaks and wondered how they could hover so perfectly in one place, feeding with such piercing precision, even while their wings were beating wildly. So much effort for the illusion of stillness! Then, in my moment of incapacity, I realized I was not so different from those hummingbirds. My body too, was undergoing a monumental effort to stabilize itself, yet for all appearances, I was just sitting there, frozen in space. When I looked up again, the pane of glass between us seemed to disappear and I felt myself right there with those hummingbirds--you might even say my soul connected with their souls--and I felt less alone in my body's efforts to remain stable. Because of the hummingbirds, I developed a new understanding of my primary pain--a constant inner tremor that rattled me to the bone. But once I could visualize that tremor with new imagery, it was no longer frightening. Instead of feeling out of control, I could now imagine my body as trying to stabilize itself with 'hummingbird energy.' But that wasn't their only gift to me. Deepening into soulfulness with the hummingbirds also led me to develop a creative practice at that time. I wanted to share my hummingbird story, but it was hard for me to talk without being distracted by pain. So instead, I began a creative practice of daily writing. I joined an online peer support group and started a blog, sharing hopes and concerns with others who were going through what I was going through. Some were further along and more healed (than I was), and I was encouraged by their progress. But the road to recovery was not direct for any of us and setbacks were frequent. During this period of uncertainty I opened myself to the healing power of gratitude, and I consider gratitude to be a facilitator of soulfulness. I was grateful for my blogging buddies and our exchanges--mostly humorous memes and beautiful images, because our brains were too scrambled to take in much else. And through our exchanges, I learned to distract myself from pain by redirecting my attention to an appreciation of beauty. I discovered that when I could pour myself into a state of gratitude or appreciation, I felt better. And if I could laugh--better yet!--I might even feel as much relief as the sedatives had once provided. And to my surprise, my buddies agreed they felt that way too. We learned together that peer support can be therapeutic, and discovered the community nature of healing. When we feel connected to others with similar challenges, it seems our bodies heal faster. It's as if we're physically lifted out of our miseries by others who can understand our pain as their own. And even though the relief I felt was temporary, the writings and images I shared with my buddies remain precious to me to this day. Such is the impact of community. When it comes to feeling seen, heard and understood, peers can feel more like family than a traditional family does, especially when living with invisible illness. Bohemian poet Rainer Maria Rilke lived with illness and depression from the time he was in grade school, and he offered this reflection on peer support in \"Letters to a Young Poet,\" letter 8: \"Do not believe that he who seeks to comfort you lives untroubled among the simple and quiet words that sometimes do you good. His life has much difficulty and sadness and remains far behind yours. Were it otherwise he would never have been able to find those words.\" Rilke's humble compassion emerged from his parallel experience; the same can be said for others who have known suffering. Those who offer extraordinary words of comfort most likely live troubled lives themselves; that's the only way they can find the words. At first I didn't understand how peer support connected with soulfulness, but it's true. The words that touch us most, often come from other troubled souls--and that's exactly why we need each other. Like soulfulness, peer support for others with illness is often expressed through gratitude, appreciation of beauty, and finding hope. Equally important is what is left unsaid-- a deep understanding, without the constant need to explain or defend one's self. In this way, illness can be a great facilitator of connection in the art of living a soulful life. When illness is chronic, a soulful outlook can be a valuable tool to help us manage pain and discomfort. By accepting soulfulness, we're accepting a perspective larger than ourselves. And when we widen the lens from 'my soul' to 'all souls,' we can see how the patterns in life repeat in nature and throughout history. Then we can contemplate those patterns, and see our own situation more clearly in relation to others. But reaching clarity takes time. Sometimes a long, long time. Today, eight years after my experience, the hummingbirds are still with me in memory, as a vivid reminder of the most challenging year of my life. Though my pain was mostly invisible, it was indeed very real. And within that experience, though I think I know it well, there are probably more lessons I have yet to understand. To help you see the value of this reminder, let's return to Rilke's Letter 8: \"We could easily be made to believe that nothing has happened, and yet we have changed, as a house changes into which a guest has entered. We cannot say who has come, perhaps we shall never know, but many signs indicate that the future enters into us in this way in order to transform itself in us long before it happens.\" The gift of the hummingbirds--offering me an image of stability when I needed it most--was so powerful it changed my life. I saw myself in their tiny bodies and their mastery of form gave me a clearer understanding of the strength inside myself. Deepening into soulfulness can help us recognize unexpected connections in the threads of everyday life. Whether it takes a few days or fourteen years, I hope your path to soulfulness is rich with images that inspire you, and companions who understand.

    "data": "I have taken approximately 2,604 birth control pills in my life. Every night for almost seven years, the incessant alarm on my phone sounds at 10pm reminding me to grab my water bottle and swallow my pill. They are a consistent aspect of my life, which being on a first-name-basis friendship with the pharmacist at my local Walgreens epitomizes. They feel like a core part of me, determining when, where, and how I start to bleed. I began taking them in the seventh grade to regulate my hormones in order to control acne. Contrary to popular belief, I am not alone in this, as many women use birth control to regulate their periods, lessen their cramps, and curtail the debilitating symptoms of PMS. My experience with these pills has been tumultuous, to say the least. At first, I could not say enough about their strength and success. My skin was clear, I knew exactly when my periods were starting, and I felt so grown-up taking a pill from an aluminum case every day. But that honeymoon period (pun intended) did not last long. About six months after taking my first pill, I returned to the doctor that had initially prescribed them. The pills were changing who I was as a person. My entire family had noticed that the week before my period, I became withdrawn and extremely moody, crying multiple times a day. At first, this was attributed to a combination of cliche teenage mood swings and PMS. However, it wasn't long until the characteristics that had defined my personality- a quick sense of humor, a happy-go-lucky attitude, and a passion for pulling pranks- had all but disappeared. To my shock, my doctor explained that this was not unusual or uncommon for women taking oral contraceptives. She told me we could experiment with different formulas of pills, but some bodies simply could not handle the pills. I was devastated. I have tried eight different kinds of birth control pills with varying levels of success. Although an inconvenience in my life, I came to terms over the years with the pill being a core aspect of my womanhood. But after spending a semester enrolled in Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies exploring why women deserve more than what society often expects them to accept, I have come to believe that we deserve more from our birth control products. My experience is not unique. Women have learned to expect serious side-effects with any form of birth control. These side-effects include, but are not limited to: nausea, weight fluctuations, headaches, anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Strangely, there is no outrage about this extreme failure in medication efficacy. In the US, 62% of women are currently on some form of birth control, yet any action being taken to improve it is underfunded and under-appreciated. Women accept less effective medications with more side effects because we, as a society, have learned to be comfortable with a lower standard of care for women. Widespread apathy towards women's health is extremely evident when one looks at a recent study experimenting with men's birth control. In this study, 320 men were given birth control shots every night for eight weeks, in an effort to share out the responsibility of avoiding unwanted pregnancies. The sample considered men of varying backgrounds and levels of sexual activity. Despite potentially optimistic results, we will never see this study brought to fruition. It was halted due to the men experiencing \"severe\" side effects, such as mood swings and acne. Prior to the termination of the study, many women were hopeful that men's birth control was finally a solution to their own undesirable experiences. However, the scientists would not allow men to endure these negative side effects for even eight weeks, when millions of women experience them for the entirety of their reproductive years. This begs the question of why society is untroubled by the less than ideal standard of care given to women yet does not believe it is acceptable for men to tolerate comparable experiences. The lack of women in STEM careers, a reluctance to believe women's symptom descriptions, and a greed-driven pharmaceutical industry are all connected to this double standard. The compounding of these three elements creates structural inequalities in healthcare that put women in physical danger and must be addressed sooner rather than later. Women are underrepresented and undervalued in STEM careers. I am a two-year member of WashU's Women in STEM Club, which aims to increase support and mentoring for women in STEM fields so that they can be better prepared to endure the journey ahead of them. As a college student aspiring to have a future career in the field of medicine, this cause directly affects the trajectory of my life. A 2013 study called \"What's So Special about STEM? A Comparison of Women's Retention in STEM and Professional Occupations\" explored the environment faced by women in different careers. The results found that women in STEM have a statistically significant increased tendency to remove themselves from their fields. Due to careful consideration of any confounding variables, the study uncovered that the main cause for the mass exodus from upper STEM fields by women is not due to children, as many people tend to believe, but rather because of a \"hostile work environment.\" This unsustainable work environment is evident at a well-known and iconic leader in the technology field, Google headquarters. In August of 2017, an executive engineer penned an internal memo to the entirety of Google named, \"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber.\" In this memo, the employee explains that women are biologically more predisposed to neuroticism, have less drive for higher status, and are more agreeable than assertive. He claims, \"This may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist and to the lower number of women in high stress jobs.\" He later explains that accommodations should never be made for any employees on the basis of gender or race, as the only reason women and minority groups are underrepresented in tech is because of \"biological disadvantages.\" This memo went unaddressed by Google leadership for many days. Eventually, an apologetic email that contained plans for improvement was sent out to the company staff, but the damage was already done. Women's perspectives are integral to the creation of a successful product for women, yet the vast majority of scientists creating, testing, and marketing birth control products are men. I believe men cannot possibly comprehend the debilitating side effects of birth control pills, and therefore will not fight as hard as women would to find a solution. Because of this, it is essential that we encourage and support young women considering careers in science-which must occur early in a girl's life. A 2004 research study done by Patricia VanLeuvan uncovered that there is a massive dip in interest in science careers of young girls between the seventh grade and the first year of high school. Careers that have better representation of women, such as medicine and biological sciences, experienced a lesser decrease in interest than less represented fields, such as engineering. This research shows that when one generation of women are inspired to pursue fields in STEM, a domino effect will result in the coming generations. A recent episode of Grey's Anatomy, one of my personal favorite shows, explored society's shortcomings at recognizing and treating women's self-reported symptoms . Dr. Miranda Bailey, a world-renowned and extremely respected Chief of Surgery, goes to a rival hospital's ER and calmly explains that she believes she is having a heart attack. The ER doctors and cardiologists, all her friends and all white males, immediately begin questioning her history of OCD and anxiety, blaming these disorders as the reason for her symptoms. Chief Bailey responds with authority and confidence, relaying that heart attacks often manifest themselves differently in women, with symptoms such as shortness of breath without pain, anxiety attacks, and jaw and neck pain. Even with her expertise and obvious medical savviness, the other doctors refuse to believe her until her heart literally stops beating for two minutes. It is no wonder that doctors regularly disregard women's self-reported symptoms, when Dr. Miranda Bailey, one of the most beloved doctors in the TV world, was not believed when she described her condition. A study aptly named, \"The Girl Who Cried Pain,\" exposed the unfortunate truth that female patients are \"more likely to be treated less aggressively in their initial encounters with the health-care system until they 'prove that they are as sick as male patients.\" This statement translates more tangibly to a nationwide average 49-minute wait time for men compared to a 65-minute wait time for women after reporting the same acute abdominal pain in an ER. The lower standard of care given to women who choose to take birth control is ignored by those who have the power to improve it, specifically a greed-driven pharmaceutical industry. \"Big pharma\" makes billions of dollars every year off of birth control products, including pills, IUDs, vaginal rings, patches, and shots. These profit margins are only increased by women trying multiple versions of each product, as they are forced to do when side effects are too debilitating for them to function. These profits serve as positive reinforcement for big pharma to continue making imperfect products. For many years, big pharma companies have gotten away with imperfect pills, knowing that they are the preferred choice of birth control for sexually active women. A recent study in the UK shows that these tides are turning. Bayer Healthcare, a leader in the market of contraception products, conducted a research study investigating women's attitude towards varying forms of birth control. This research was confirmed by the Office of National Statistics, and found that 31% of women chose, at some point in their lives, to switch from the pill to Long Acting Reversible Contraception, or LARC's. These women were totally unsatisfied with the side effects and overall effectiveness of the pill and decided that their bodies and minds deserved better. Society has taught women to expect a lower standard of care from all healthcare providers, ranging from doctors to CEO's of pharmaceutical companies. This custom is dangerous for the physical and mental well-being of women, which further effects all aspects of society. Therefore, it is time that we, as women, demand more for ourselves. We deserve birth control that does its job with no side effects. We deserve to be heard when we go to the Emergency Room asking for help. We deserve to be represented in fields that make decisions about our health. We deserve (birth) control. \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper.\" Grey's Anatomy, season 14, episode 11, ABC, 1 Feb. 2018. https://www.hulu.com/watch/1215330.

    "data": "Zachary went through puberty twice, first as a girl, then as a boy, after he started taking hormones. \"The second time was a lot better,\" he said. \"I got excited when my voice cracked, and when I started to smell different,\" though he adds that excitedly telling friends that you smell really bad is kind of a conversation killer.. Zachary is transgender. He was born female but he has always known, even before he could articulate it, that he is male. His journey has been challenging, and he suffered from depression for many years as a result. But he is now a confident, happy, inspiring young man Last month, Zachary, 19, graduated from Methuen high school. He'll start Wheelock College in the fall, where he has received the four-year, $20,000 annual Passion for Action scholarship for his demonstrated commitment to community service, leadership and scholarship. He plans to become a social worker with the goal of working with LBGT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) kids. Medically, a transgender person can choose to pursue hormonal treatment and/or surgery in order to bring the biological sex closer to the gender identity, though no intervention is a necessity. For female to male trans people, like Zachary, the surgical options include removal of the reproductive organs, \"top surgery\" (mastectomy), or \"bottom surgery\" (construction of male genitalia). For now, Zachary has chosen to pursue hormones, removal of his uterus and ovaries and top surgery, but doesn't feel that he needs to have bottom surgery. He stresses that this is a personal decision, and that no two transgender people are the same. Sexual orientation among transgender people is equally varied. Zachary identifies as bisexual. He has dated females in the past and currently has a boyfriend who is a female to male trans like himself. Their shared experiences have brought them very close. I have learned a tremendous amount from Zachary. I now better understand that people are born with a biological sex and a gender identity, and that these don't always match up. Trying to ignore ones gender identity, or to force it to align with ones biological sex when this doesn't feel right, is painful and psychologically detrimental. To feel whole, gender identity must be embraced, but when there is incongruity between biological sex and gender identity, as is the case for transgender individuals, society doesn't make this easy. Most importantly, Zachary has taught me that we all need to educate ourselves and develop tolerance toward transgender individuals. He is a person with tremendous courage and integrity, but he has been forced to deal with a more difficult set of decisions than most of us, and with societal discrimination. This week, the Joint Committee on the Judiciary in Massachusetts held a hearing to determine the future of the Equal Access Bill. This bill would add \"gender identity\" to the Massachusetts civil rights law for public accommodations. As it stands, this law prohibits discrimination on the basis of \"age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, sex and marital status\" in public accommodations, but does not protect transgender individuals. Put simply, this means that Zachary could be denied service or treated unfairly in a restaurant, an airport, a retail store, a public bathroom, on public transportation and so on. According to a national transgender discrimination survey published this year, up to 50% of transgender individuals in Massachusetts have experienced verbal harassment or mistreatment in public accommodations.

    "data": "A Nurse's Reflection back to March 2020 This happened at the beginning. Before the tyvek suits, and the extra ICU beds. Before the empty streets howled with what we've all lost. When Italy served as an example of what we must not become, when we still had hope we could \"flatten the curve.\" Before we had all held the hands of the dying in place of their family, before every room was filled with a coughing, proned patient, before we knew what we were doing. In early March 2020, I was the first nurse to go into a room with a suspected Covid-19 patient. The tests were taking a week to come back at that point, we only had a few suspected patients. Since I didn't live with family or roommates, I was the safest choice, so I was the first one in. Those first few cases were discharged without results, none of them ended up coming back positive, we were still waiting for our first confirmed case. We knew it was coming, it was only a matter of time before one of them came back positive. In this in-between time, I met Robert. He had been discharged from our floor less than a month before. He had a significant respiratory history: at home he lived on a constant 8L of oxygen, but it had gotten harder for him to breathe. He lived with his brother who had just attended a funeral, and some attendants had just come back positive. Robert's brother hadn't been feeling well, but it was Robert who ended up with us, in a room at the end of the hall, with a steadily climbing oxygen requirement. That first night he was sick, but stable. The next night I came back to find something different. We had never seen it before, but we would see this escalation again and again in the coming months. No amount of oxygen was enough. I was in that room every 10 minutes increasing his oxygen until he was on the maximum amount we could currently offer on the floor. Robert was very clear: he was a DNR/DNI. There would be no ICU for him, so instead he got me. While I was in his room turning up his oxygen, he told me about his years as a wedding planner, about a bride who had left her dress at the airport, about how he could spot who would make it and who wouldn't. But when I could turn his oxygen up no further, our conversation switched. Just as he had known which couples would last and which wouldn't, he knew what his outcome would be. He looked at me and said through his oxygen mask, \"It's okay, I've had a good life, I'm ready.\" I had never had this conversation before. I had only been a nurse for a year at this point. On my floor, when someone was imminently dying, they were usually not this aware. But this was a different kind of death. \"Will I go tonight?\" he asked. \"I don't know,\" I responded. \"We've never seen this before.\" I don't know if he saw the tears slowly rolling down my cheeks as I medicated him. If he did, he didn't say anything. So I sat with him, monitored his medication, and held his hand while he slipped into unconsciousness. I work the night shift on a medical floor. I start at 7:00pm and end at 7:00am. All of this took place before midnight. I felt like I had already run a marathon. I left Robert's room while he still breathed but no longer responded, blinded by the bright lights of the hallway. Though we didn't have his results yet, somehow all the nurses knew: we knew we were seeing something different. While Robert struggled to breathe at the end of the hall, I turned to face my coworkers and other patients. \"John is causing problems,\" they told me. John was another patient of mine. He was on an involuntary psychiatric hold, and completely healthy. He had told the Emergency Department he had a cough, so they swabbed him for Covid and sent him to us. We were woefully ill-equipped to handle psych patients, especially with Covid. We had him confined to his room because he was potentially infectious. He would stand at the doorway, pacing like a caged animal, shouting abuses at the staff who monitored him for safety. John was desperate for a cigarette. He had been pacing his room for four days, antsy with no entertainment, no freedom, and no cigarettes. I had already been giving more nicotine gum to him than I probably should have, but it wasn't making a dent. He alternated between screaming at staff and pleading with us. Offering us a mix of abuse and bargains, screams and apologies. My coworkers were right, he was escalating. John was leaning outside his door while the nurses' aides tried to shoo him back inside. We called security, who came up to linger in the hallways, and we called the doctors. It was decided that for everyone's safety we needed to get him sedated. I filled two syringes, one with Haldol, one with Ativan, and with one of my best friends by my side, suited up and walked into John's room. We didn't know what we were going to get with him, so I very gently said, \"John, we have some medication, it is going to calm you down, is that okay?\" Much to my surprise, he responded, \"Okay.\" \"My friend and I are going to inject you at the same time, one in each arm, okay?\" \"Okay.\" Quick and easy, no issue, full cooperation. The doctor left, security left, I took off my protective gown, my gloves, I washed my hands, and as I was walking away, John seized his opportunity. He bolted out of his room like a drunken racehorse at the starting gate. The sedatives had started to kick in, and he wobbled his way down the halls, hooked a sharp left and sprinted haphazardly past the elevators. One of the nurse's aids and I started after him. He wasn't allowed to leave, and he was potentially spreading Covid with every surface he crashed into. \"John,\" we shouted, \"please stop, come back!\" But with a determination brewed over days of nicotine withdrawal he continued to rocket down the hallways, past the room in which Robert lay dying, and launched himself into the back stairwell. We were hot on his heels as he plummeted down four flights of stairs and shot out the doorway at the bottom, opening out into the hospital driveway. He had reached freedom. The cold March air invigorated him and he pressed forward, towards the main street, while the two of us trailed behind him, shouting his name. Security followed us out the door shortly thereafter and we caught up to him just as he was about to run out onto the road. I held his arm in my ungloved hand and he immediately surrendered to his recapture, allowing himself to be steered back to the main door. As we passed through the doors to the hospital, John looked at me, my hands bare, my face uncovered, and with such genuine remorse said, \"I'm sorry.\" It took everything in me not to laugh. The whiplash between my two patients had me reeling. This contrast between intense, frenzied chaos and small, tender moments of sadness would continue throughout the rest of this pandemic for me and my coworkers. This was only the beginning, after all. After administering a few more sedatives, I tucked John into bed and tried to make it until morning. An hour after my shift ended, before I had even gotten a chance to leave the hospital, John's test came back negative. He was sent to psychiatry a few hours later. Robert died later that day. He died before his results came back, but he was our official first case. First case and first death, all in one night. I went home with my best friend and coworker. We had a few early morning drinks and braced ourselves for the months to come, finding moments of joy and hilarity. Who would've expected that at the end of our first year as nurses we would find ourselves in the middle of a global pandemic, watching people gasp for life and chasing patients through the halls.

    "data": "By Rene Morales In February 2018, two days after my fiftieth birthday, I began to feel a tingling and burning sensation on the right side of my forehead. Over the next few days, the tingling grew into electric shocks whenever I touched that area of my face. Concerned, I saw my doctor who immediately sent me to radiology for an MRI of my brain. Two days later, my doctor informed me of the results of the MRI: Trigeminal Neuralgia, a rare and chronic pain condition. My Trigeminal Nerve is in contact with an artery and carries sensation from my face to my brain. The pain associated with this disorder is considered by many to be the worst pain a human can endure. In the past, it was commonly referred to as the \"Suicide Disease\" because the intense pain and resulting high rates of depression lead many to end their lives. Upon this diagnosis, I quickly became depressed and isolated myself away from my family. My wife and children watched helplessly as I suffered. I perceived their looks as pity which caused me to feel weak, a false reality I created in my head. Already struggling with anxiety and negative thinking, I battled with the thoughts now racing through my mind. How would I get through this? What would this do to my marriage? Now filled with fear, I envisioned only agonizing pain and loneliness. I questioned if I would ever find comfort from anyone or anything again, leading me to worst-case scenarios where I would ultimately want to end my life. Unable to accept my new normal, I entered the stages of grief due to the loss of the person I once was, skipping over denial and straight to anger and depression. The terrible pain of this disorder was like an electrical storm raging through my head. Ominous clouds rolling in, hurricane-force winds causing mass destruction, sideways rain and powerful bolts of lightning reverberating within my head and shooting down my body whenever I spoke, touched my forehead, brushed my teeth, showered, or even smiled. I became concerned for my future. I thought I would no longer be able to work, support my family, and I would ultimately become a burden to those I loved. I began to lose hope. Each painful shock made me angrier. I turned to food and alcohol for comfort and gained over twenty pounds in two months. Whenever possible, I retreated to my bedroom and began a life of isolation, rarely coming out to engage with anyone. As the days turned into weeks and weeks turned to months, I became more of a roommate than a husband to the love of my life. My negative reactions to the disorder drove me deeper into depression, severely affecting my marriage and my mental health. My wife struggled with how to deal with me. She quit her well-paid position at a local hospital to start her own private practice as a mental health counselor so she could care for me and ensure I had the support I needed. She did everything she could to be there for me, but rather than accept her influences, I wallowed in self-pity and allowed my situation to get the better of me regardless of her actions. My negative responses placed a wedge between my family and me. After months of isolation and self-destructive behavior, my relationship with my wife was severely strained. We were both unhappy with the person I had become and I was adrift in a sea of depression. It was at that low point that I realized I no longer wanted the life I had created. Something had to change. I had to choose to either sink further into the abyss of depression or pull myself out and find my way back to who I was prior to my diagnosis. In order to bring myself back to life, I had to focus on positive thinking and radical acceptance of my situation. While I did not have to like my situation, I had to accept that I had this disorder and find ways to live my best life regardless of my situation. I began to change my outlook on life. Instead of feeling sorry for myself, I found peace in the knowledge that my situation could be so much worse than it was. Rather than being diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia, I could have been diagnosed with inoperable stage four cancer and had only months to live. I needed to adopt a better perspective, embrace all the positive aspects in my life such as the love and support offered by my family. Lastly, I had to come to terms with my diagnosis, and not view it as the end of life as I knew it. One of the first steps I took towards recovery was to learn and understand everything I could about Trigeminal Neuralgia, including treatments, both traditional and non-traditional. I was prescribed several medications, all of which caused terrible side effects such as dizziness, fatigue, nausea, muscle pain, and stuttering. Due to these side effects, I began to experiment with cannabidiol (CBD) oil, a product derived from cannabis and hemp, which was used as an anti-seizure medication and a neuroprotective. The first form of CBD I tried was a paste derived from cannabis that tasted terrible. After several months without relief, I moved onto CBD oil derived from hemp. This CBD oil was infused with coconut oil and naturally flavored with orange peel. It tasted tropical and sweet and a thousand times better than the cannabis-based paste. Within two weeks of starting this treatment I was having fewer episodes, and the pain was less severe. Within two months, I no longer had episodes of pain and began to feel like myself prior to the diagnosis. I was overjoyed by this discovery and believed I had turned an important corner regarding treatment. Now pain free, I promised myself to make time for the things I always wanted to do but never did. I had been given a second chance at life, and I had to make the most of this opportunity. I resumed the activities I loved such as competitive storytelling and singing karaoke and no longer took for granted the simple pleasures of smiling or having a good laugh. I savored each day believing that perhaps I was cured or possibly misdiagnosed; however, I soon discovered the reason the pain had subsided was due to a period of remission, not from any method of treatment. During this six-month period of remission, my neurologist informed me that some people experience remission ranging from a month to two years. There is no explanation for why these periods of remission happen or what triggers the return. Navigating through these ups and downs is extremely challenging, because each time the pain returns, I am affected differently; the pain is either more intense or it affects a different part of my face. In addition to struggling with this intense pain, the mental struggle of facing the reality that my much-enjoyed break from the disorder has ended crushes my hopes for a sustained period of relief. I am very open regarding my struggle with Trigeminal Neuralgia, and have shared my perspectives through a variety of platforms. I'm often asked how I manage my life with such uncertainty and pain. The only words that come to mind are \"You just have to.\" While I never chose to have this disorder, how I react to it and how I choose to live my life are up to me. It took years for me to get to where I am, and if I can offer any advice it would be this: radically accept your situation and do not allow your illness to take away your very soul and everything that makes you who you are. In the two and a half years since my diagnosis, I have learned a lot about myself. I have endured the darkest pits of depression and savored the highest heights of personal and professional achievement. I have become closer to my family and learned the value of time, relationships, and self-acceptance. I did not learn these lessons on my own. I know that the life I have today would not be possible without the loving support of my wife, children, friends, and co-workers. I still have days where I struggle -- days filled with extreme pain and constant concern for my future. I've learned to accept those bad days and allow myself that time because no one is perfect. I give myself those moments, and when I'm done, I pick myself up, dust myself off, and do what I need to do to see myself through the days, weeks, and months that stand before me. In doing so, I believe I set a positive example for others. I show that one can thrive while living with an incurable and painful disorder, and that being diagnosed with such a condition is not the end of the world. My life is challenging and filled with uncertainty, but that has not stopped me from being who I am and growing into who I want to be.

    "data": "By Dianne You are allowing me to share my voice in your head - that is a sacred responsibility. There is intimacy in living in someone else's mind and sharing that moment and I want to acknowledge that. I also want to acknowledge that there are many different pieces to my story, and this is just one small part of that. As someone who suffers from grief, loss, trauma, anxiety and depression, I find a lot of meaning in sharing my story. Just by receiving it, you are giving me meaning. ~ When I was about seven years old, I remember jumping in the back of my parents 1992 Plymouth voyager - you know, those ones with the wooden paneling on the side. I was eager and excited that it was finally my turn again to make the three-hour road trip to my grandparents' house for the weekend. My grandparents were so important to me and my two older sisters. We cycled through visiting them. My papa taught me how to fish in the pond behind their house. I always insisted he throw back the pregnant fish. He insisted he did, as if he could really tell (eye roll). My grandma used to tell me I was going to be a doctor. Since I was seven years old, she was grooming me. We would play doctor together with her old stethoscope from her nursing days and her old leg cast from when she broke her femur - me and grandma ended up having that in common, as I broke my femur a year ago. She never stopped telling me how great of a provider I would be one day. Years later, they moved down the street from us so I got to stop by whenever I would pass their house on my runs around the block or on my drive home from high school. When saying goodbye, her five foot two inch, frail but mighty warm body would squeeze me as tight as it could around my boney hips and call me doctor. I'd roll my eyes, look down and smile, \"you know grandma, I don't know if that's what I'm meant to be,\" I'd say, before telling her I loved her and giving her a big kiss. My grandma died when I was a freshman at Brown. It was spring, we were in the middle of my lacrosse season. Balancing school and lacrosse was hard. I was still deciding on what major I was going to declare so I filled my course load with chemistry, calculus and neuroscience that year just in case I needed to go pre-med. Grandma was always on my mind. Fast forward five years. I had graduated from Brown and attended graduate school to become a Physician's Assistant. I think Grandma would have been proud. I was working as a surgical PA and living 25 minutes from my parents - never did I ever want to live that close to my parents but it low key was the best. And the work. It was exciting and meaningful. I didn't mind being - as my colleagues would say - \"verbally assaulted by our arrogant attending surgeons in the OR and overworked for being new by working all the weekend and overnight shifts despite what our contract said.\" It was worth it to me. Call me crazy. I loved the thrill of the unknown emergencies that would arise, and the calmness those shifts required of me. And I loved operating. Plus, it provided me with a comfortable lifestyle, living within my means, saving for retirement, dating, living with my best friend from high school, dreaming about the future while loving and appreciating the present moment. I was no longer stressed with schoolwork 24/7. And I got to see my family almost every weekend. I made it, I thought. I was in my late 20s and living the life of my dreams. A typical day for me? My alarm goes off for 4:45am, I snooze it. 4:47am, snooze, 4:50...crap! I shoot up from bed, my workout class starts at 5:00. quickly I throw on the workout clothes I'd laid out the night before. Sneakers on, water bottle full, sweat towel and keys in hand and I'm off. I sprint down to my car. I pull a U-turn and I speed down the road one mile to my gym. I'm 2 minutes late. Trust me, nothing has changed there, except now it is maybe 20, 30 minutes late everywhere I go. They already started the warm-up run. I throw my belongings down and jet to catch up with everyone as they jog around the building in the crisp morning air. I'm half asleep but I don't want to be anywhere else. The intensity of this gym sets the tone for my day. Lights are out, music is blasting, and 25 athletes are pushing their bodies to the limit. There are free weights, cardio, yelling, teamwork - everything that gets my blood pumping and endorphins released. Just like that and it's over, all too fast. I'm back in my apartment. I hop in the shower. I only have 20 minutes before I need to be at work. I'm rushing to the max. But I live for this. I make it to work, change into my scrubs and sneakers and I'm at the table for change of shift and sign out - where my overnight colleagues give us report on what happened during their shifts and updates on all current patients on our census. It was March of 2020. It had been four years since I did a semester abroad in Greece and traveled all throughout Europe. It was time to travel internationally again. So, me and a couple of friends packed up and we were going to Brazil. We made it as far as Florida when the world shut down. When we began having to realistically consider if we would be stuck in Brazil if we went, we knew we weren't going. Back in Syracuse, New York, I returned to work, - there is no work-from-home for hospital workers, so, back to my typical days... On my days off, I'd sleep in and spend the afternoons hiking, going on long runs, roller blading, boating on the lake and watching sunsets. May I remind you though, it's July 2020. Everything was shut down. There wasn't really anything else to do but to enjoy nature and appreciate what was right in front of me. I had to lean into that side of me, I needed an outlet - I was still healing from a breakup - which was really the least of my worries. I wasn't able to hug or kiss my dying uncle or my newborn nephew due to the steady surge of covid-19 cases. Watching the sunsets helped. There's really something about sunsets isn't there? Might it be that sunsets are a reminder that no matter what happened in your day, it can end beautifully?And then, just like that, an opportunity to reset. The sunset on Sunday, July 19, 2020, did, just like that, end beautifully. But the reset took a bit longer. I had been working a four-day stretch of 12-hour shifts. After work I took a long shower, longer than usual actually, and I'm so glad I enjoyed it because little did I know that it would be the last time I would ever be able to shower myself. I sunk into the couch, pajamas on and hair still wet, as I looked out the window and saw the beautiful sunset. I couldn't help but want to get a better view and enjoy the warm summer heat. I grabbed a blanket and climbed the ladder up to the roof like I had done plenty of times before. I lay up there watching the sun escape beneath the horizon, and then, as it darkened, admiring the stars take over the sky. The quiet peacefulness of the dark night cleared my mind. I remember reflecting on how free I felt - as if the world were at my fingertips. I felt so alive and powerful, recalling how I had been able to contribute to saving someone's life earlier that night. I have the best job in the world, I thought. I truly found my calling. This is what I'm meant to be doing. When it was time to descend the 12-foot ladder in the darkness, I lost my footing and slipped. As I was falling, I specifically remember expecting to land on my two feet. I'm an athlete after all. Instead, all of a sudden, I was on my back on the hard cement ground at the base of the ladder looking up at the same starry sky that had just provided me with such peace. I felt immediate pain in my right shoulder and thought, \"that's gonna hurt like a bitch in the morning.\" Nothing else hurt though and I quickly learned why. I went to flex my abs and put my arm out to crunch my upper body forward, but nothing happened. I brought my chin to my chest and saw my legs were not where my mind thought they were. My knees were bent, and my legs were crumbled next to me. I went to move them, and again, nothing happened. In that moment, I knew that I was paralyzed. And then an eerie silence took over....the calm before the storm if you will. I fell on top of my phone, so Siri wasn't registering to call 911. I didn't know how long I had to prepare myself for the chaos and uncertainty that was to come before someone found me and took me to the hospital. I didn't know how long I had to reminisce about my 27 years of life. To think about how relatively privileged my life had been up until this point. Did I take advantage of it? Am I getting punished? Would I have done anything differently? I had just settled into my job after years of schooling. Was it all for nothing? Will I ever operate again? I was so embarrassed and in disbelief with what just happened. Can I rewind? To my surprise, even with all these racing thoughts, I remained relatively calm. I knew I could do more damage if I panicked. All I could do was take a deep breath and wait for everything to change. As I was about to enter the OR to go into surgery to decompress my spinal cord and repair my broken neck, I finally broke down crying for the first time. I was on the phone with my parents, terrified of what the outcome would be - my surgical knowledge knew there were huge risks. When I woke up from surgery and saw my mom sitting next to me, all I could do was smile because I was so happy to be awake and alive. But then, seeing my mom's horrified face, reality hit. I felt so bad for causing my family pain. I knew they were so scared, and I apologized endlessly as each one visited me, one at a time - covid rules. I blamed myself for what had happened - four years later and I'm still working on forgiving myself. As the days passed and complications arose, I became so angry. Why aren't my nerves waking up? Why can't I wiggle my toes? Why can't I move my fingers? Just give me my goddamn fingers... anger turned into fury. Unable to move the majority of my body while lying awake but with a breathing tube down my throat, I had panic attacks almost every night. The tube eventually came out but because my diaphragm was affected by my injured spinal cord, I had to relearn how to breathe entirely. This was complicated by a punctured lung, pneumonia, and a mucous plug. I was so frustrated that I wasn't progressing. Twelve days after my fall, it was my birthday, and I was begging my attending for a tracheotomy as I felt like I was drowning in my own saliva. The outpouring of community support I received through cards, flowers and gifts kept me from entering a depression in the hospital. There was this one card that I had taped to my wall, across from my bed and right under the tv - I am brave, I am strong, I am loved. I would recite that to myself dozens of times per day. I am brave, I am strong, I am loved. I had so much gratitude in my heart and was hopeful that if I put in the work, I would make a full recovery - because that's what life had taught me up until this point. I was never the smartest or most athletic, but I knew how to work hard. This eager and hardworking spirit, though, led me to try to move my new body before I was ready. I was alone in my room most of the time - visitors were still very much restricted - but I had no time to waste. PT and OT sessions were so short, I felt like it was up to me to practice swinging my legs to the side of the bed. How was I ever going to walk in six months if I can't even do that yet, I thought. Well, this resulted in many falls off the bed which of course left me feeling disappointed as I lay stuck and helpless on the ground. Once, I couldn't reach the call bell, so I just had to wait until my nurse came into the room and frantically called a rapid response. I quickly had about ten sets of eyes looking down at me. I felt like a heavy piece of furniture that they had to brainstorm how to lift. I later earned myself a new piece of hospital jewelry and this one said \"fall risk.\" I feel like they should have known considering how I got to the hospital in the first place. When I left the hospital and entered the next stage of my recovery, rehab at Boston's Spaulding Rehabilitation center, I became overwhelmed as I learned just how many changes I would have to make in my everyday life once I got back into the world. \"Recovery\" was so much more than just going to physical therapy. Bowel and bladder management, chronic pain, low blood pressure, medications, pressure sores, UTIs, short-term disability, long-term disability, SSI vs SSDI, wheelchair fittings, adaptive tools, and equipment. I felt so alone, constantly trying to explain to people what I needed when I didn't even know myself. Realizing that I would likely be in a chair the rest of my life made me question if I wanted to live this life at all. That was terrifying. I've always been an optimistic person, so these kinds of thoughts were so foreign to me. the American philosopher Cornel West says that \"there's a fine line between optimism and hope. Optimism is a naive mindset,\" he says, and \"hope is real.\" With time, I got the daily help and equipment I needed, and I settled down into a routine. My personal care needs and daily tasks became a little easier. I eventually accepted that I would never get my old life back, and I discovered that I don't have to walk to be happy - don't get it twisted, I WANT TO WALK and my will to walk will never cease, but acceptance helped me develop a sense of real hope for the future. Not optimism, hope. Hope for a cure. Hope that if I keep my body strong and healthy, once there is a cure, I will be ready. Hope, in the meantime, for happiness and independence. BUT, even with all that awesome progress and hope, grief persisted. Why? Because grief never really goes away. Grieving is physically exhausting. For me, I'm constantly feeling sleep deprived but then feeling guilty for sleeping too much because then I feel lazy and unproductive. So, then I go on autopilot, but on autopilot you can only go as fast as the speed limit and in this body the speed limit is negative two mph. This injury, on the surface, is a physical injury, and because of this, rehabbing the physical body is the priority. But grief is powerful and is not just in the mind. If we do not tend to our grief it will reemerge in our body and limit our recovery. We'll stay frozen and dissociate. Then, it will show up in our lives as depression, stagnancy, disconnection from our emotions and relationships. I'm a big believer in the phrase, \"you can't heal the pain you refuse to feel.\" Feel the pain. Feel the grief and all the emotions that come with it. You will emerge. When the worst possible thing you can imagine happens, you have to celebrate that you made it through, that you survived. It's wrong to say you find a silver lining, but you manage to continue on. Day after day. One foot in front of the other, figuratively speaking of course - maybe I should say one rotation after another. You make it your life's work to survive this thing. I wouldn't say it gets easier with time. Time definitely does not shrink grief. Your grief will stay the same, but your world will grow around it. I still struggle with my trauma and my grief from losing the life I built. Just last month I was on the couch in my apartment. It's Sunday and I'm forcing myself to relax and do nothing - which often makes me feel guilty \"I don't deserve to relax or have fun anymore,\" my brain usually tells me. And this time it feels like I'm being punished for it. My insulin pump is malfunctioning. I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, before my injury, when I was 18 years old. Technology has come such a long way and if it weren't for technology, I doubt I would be living on my own. But technology fails us sometimes. And on those days, I fear for my life. The thing with malfunctioning insulin pumps, once you troubleshoot the problem, it usually takes a few hours to truly know if it is resolved or not. Well, a couple of cycles of that and I've spent all day troubleshooting. This means my blood sugar has been hanging out at 400 or above for more than 12 hours. My body begins to feel weak, my brain foggy and I'm dying of thirst - but I've already finished the two water bottles I've brought to the couch. It begins to get dark, and this is when I start panicking. I'm brought back to the feelings of being stuck on the ground and the embarrassment that I need help. But I can't get in touch with anyone and that only makes the panic worse. If only I could get up and walk to turn on the lights, walk to get more water, and most importantly walk to get more insulin. If only my fingers worked properly maybe my troubleshooting efforts wouldn't have failed. Now I'm hyperventilating and I have flashbacks of the panic attacks I had in the hospital. It's a complete ambush. Instead of trying to suppress it though, I let it out. I'm balling until someone is by my side. I need a hug. You see, grief never goes away. But my world around me has truly flourished. Every day brings new stressors and challenges, and every challenge is an opportunity to learn and to grow. To make myself a better person. Not every challenge is a grief ambush, thank heavens. When you first get injured, they tell you your recovery will be between six months and two years. I laugh at that now. I dedicated two full years to just recovery. My sole focus was to get as much functional return as possible while pushing the limits of independence. I was going to therapy every day. I was trying every adaptive sport and treating it as a cross training opportunity. I was talking to as many experts in the field and as many people living with spinal cord injuries as possible. I was listening to as many SCI podcasts as I could. I was researching and involved in countless research studies. And I was having surgery after surgery so I could at least use my hands to my advantage. I didn't stop doing any of that after two years, but my priorities shifted. I wanted to get back to work. I wanted to provide for myself, contribute to society and have a purpose again. I've been open about my mental health from the very beginning which really helped me understand that I have perspective and empathy and patience that I never had before. My career as a surgical PA was dedicated to fixing the physical body but now more than ever, I know there's power in healing the mind. Which led me to accept a position as a psychiatric PA. That has also brought its own challenges but I'm learning that this injury is a constant eb and flow of adapting. I still sometimes can't help but look at others my age and think how easy their life is compared to mine, how good and normal they have it. But then I look at mine and hell, some days I get more accomplished in one day now than I did before my injury. Next week I'm being flown out to DC and then LA for a new job I took in the adaptive sports industry. You see, the disabled community is never a community you aspire to be in, but once you are in it, you realize how badass your peers are and you want to be involved with them as much as you can. I do. They are a community that lift me up like no other. I feel seen and heard. I never feel like a burden. So, when Heidi and Jess asked Stefan and I to start a support group for people our age, it was an easy yes. I miss my old life so much. I miss my relationship with my old friends, my relationship with my family. I miss being a naive optimist. But I think some of that comes with the territory of growing up. I was going to miss those things whether I got hurt or not.",

    "data": "Have you ever tried writing poetry when struggling as a patient or the caregiver of a loved one? Writing a poem can feel like a meditative practice. You slow down, consider your thoughts, and ponder topics for your poem. Your mind can wander over territories well-known and those unknown. You explore questions like: Why am I in this place? How will I move from denial to acceptance? Or, will I ever reclaim my life? Along the way you may uncover thoughts previously unknown. Poetry opens a door to vast possibilities for self-expression. After my daughter Elizabeth died from a rare bone cancer at the age of fourteen, poetry sprang forth from me. Unplanned, unrehearsed, unnerving at times. As I read my journal entries written during Elizabeth's yearlong illness, I knew that somehow, I had to process my pain, my anger, my devastation. With pen in hand, I delved deep into foreign lands. Overtime, I discovered that drawing metaphors with the natural world allowed me to open up but not feel too vulnerable, to take risks, and to unfurl tightly held emotions. I'd like to share a poem that I wrote. I hope that after reading my poem, you might consider picking up your pen and writing one, too. Waves of Life Snow follows a day of sun; Cold follows a day of warmth; Pain follows a day of joy. I have learned that I will never know what the next day will hold, but I am no longer afraid of this uncertainty. Changes are the waves of life-- we will not know their strength, or how hard the waves will hit the beach, but they will flow in each day and night, ever changing, ever free. If we can learn one vital truth, we will be set free: Life constantly changes but we are never alone, the earth is under us, the waves break before us, the moon shines upon us, family and friends comfort us, and the one who has left us, encircles us with love.

    "data": "Lani Peterson, Psy.D. Director, City Mission's Public Voice By Val Walker Everywhere we look, it seems too many people insist on having the last word--on TV (the election campaigns, the pundits and experts), on Facebook, at our office meetings, at our kitchen tables. We all know how it feels to be trying to tell our story, but some \"listeners\" must have the last word. Those last-word conversationalists take our message and turn it into theirs. They usurp the meaning of our message before we can even finish our story. We not only feel unheard and unvalued, but downright robbed. We may have cynically concluded we're living in a last-word culture, so we're forced to be last-word conversationalists ourselves to survive these days. This last-word problem has been bugging me, particularly this election year. But thankfully, contributing to Health Story Collaborative has become a way to proclaim the sanctity of telling our stories and having fruitful conversations-- free from last-word conversationalists. Through Health Story Collaborative, I'm fired up about the transformative connection between storyteller and story listener when we go beyond having the last word. To add a fresh perspective on the topic of going beyond the last word, we've invited Lani Peterson to weigh in on how sharing each other's stories--the telling and the listening-- creates meaning for our lives. We are pleased she could join us. Lani is a psychologist, professional storyteller and coach who specializes in the use of story as a healing art and powerful medium for personal growth, connection and change. Drawing on her broad and varied experience with individuals, teams and organizations in the profit and nonprofit worlds, Lani brings a unique combination of personal stories, knowledge of the theory behind stories, and vast experience helping people use stories to transform their understanding of themselves and others. Lani is currently the director of City Mission's Public Voice, currently working with Boston's homeless to tell their stories for healing and social change. Lani's professional training includes a Doctorate in Psychology from William James University, and a Masters in Counseling Psychology from Lesley University. She is a member of the National Speakers Association, the National Storytelling Network, and serves on the Executive Committee of the Healing Story Alliance, which she recently chaired for five years. Perched on a green velvet sofa in Lani's sunny living room in Cambridge, I enjoyed our lively, two-hour conversation chock-full of aha!-moments and astute observations. My mug of coffee was left untouched on her table, as her stories and insights so intrigued me. I'd like to share the highlights of the experiences that have transformed Lani's life as well as the lives of the many people she has touched through her work. To do justice to her wisdom, I'm presenting her \"answers\" to my questions as inspired stories in their own right. When did you know in your bones that your calling was storytelling? Lani: Living in Philadelphia in the 90s, I was a psychologist as well as the mother of four young children under the age of six, two of whom were adopted. Trying to balance both my career and family, I worked for a time as a community outreach worker presenting talks on parenting to a wide variety of groups. Although I had completed my doctorate in psychology and was licensed to practice therapy in three states, I had put my private practice on hold. I had worked with clients for nearly ten years, but still wrestled with doubts about whether I had enough knowledge, training or skill to truly help another heal. Self-doubt caused me to relentlessly pursue more reading, training and learning about what practices led to healing, but ironically, the more I learned, the more I doubted my own skill as a healer. Teaching (while simultaneously learning!) parenting skills seemed like the perfect safe road to follow while figuring out what I wanted to do when both my children and I grew up. One evening, I was invited to speak to an audience of 300 parents on the topic, \"Children and Self-Esteem.\" So there I was in front of this huge room full of people, telling parents about how to foster self-esteem in their children, all the while not clear in my own gut that I had the right stuff myself. I plowed through my prepared material anyway, and as I concluded my lecture, I invited the audience to ask questions. After many practical questions about child discipline, one woman bravely spoke up and shared some of her story before asking a question. She had come to the US from India after her husband died, hoping to give her son a better life. But sadly, her son was being bullied at school, and she felt helpless to do anything about this. \"Do I stay here, or should I go back to India?\" she implored. It seemed the whole room felt her confusion and despair. I knew I had to say something, offer something to her, but none of the theory or literature I had on the subject felt relevant. Somehow, a story came to mind from a much younger time in my own life. Before I started, I let her know, \"I don't know yet why I need to tell you this story, so do with it what you will.\" I told her about a time when I was a student at Smith College, and asked to fill in at the last minute to do an interview with the famous poet, Maya Angelou. My roommate, who was scheduled to do the interview, had come down with the flu and asked me to step in in her place. She handed me a list of questions to ask and sent me off. After hearing Maya Angelou speak and share her poetry, all the questions I had with me felt meaningless. So when I finally sat down with Maya Angelou after her performance to interview her, I spoke instead about my own feelings of being lost and confused, seeking out whatever comfort and wisdom she might offer me. Maya took my hand, and said, \"Let me tell you right now, dear, there isn't one right path. It's all about how you walk on the path you're on. So, if you fall into a hole, let yourself grieve and cry, and when you climb back out--and you will--you can find your way to dance again.\" As I told my own story of being lost and confused to this woman standing alone in the audience, it felt like we were in a trance, in a deep, one-to-one connection, although the room was filled with 300 people. When finished speaking, I simply uttered, \"That's all I know.\" The woman, appearing moved by Maya Angelou's message, simply said, \"Thank you. It is enough.\" I watched as the woman left the auditorium that night surrounded by a group of other audience members who appeared to be reaching out to her. I realized that something profound had happened. I realized the act of telling one's story as well as the act of listening to stories was indeed more than enough to support one on the healing journey. That moment of profound connection between teller and listener provided a revelation for me both professionally and personally: Through stories we can courageously share our vulnerabilities, understand the truth of our experiences, and create new meanings for those experiences. It was a new way of understanding how insight, understanding, and healing could occur. For me, it was also the moment when I discovered my calling. What a moment that was, Lani, a moment of truth if there ever was one. And now, as the person interviewing you, your story about interviewing Maya Angelou certainly speaks to me. There are so many layers to any story, and each time we share it with a different person or group, we find a different meaning or takeaway from it. This leads me to ask you, on a deeper level, what happens between the storyteller and the story listener? Lani: First of all, we're all story listeners, even when we hear our own stories. When we speak out loud, our words enter a different part of our brain, the auditory part of our brain, the part of our brain that listens, so we are hearing ourselves in a very different way than when we think only to ourselves. We become a listener to our own story, enabling us to take a different perspective, gain insight and perhaps discover new meaning in what we have said. That's so true, Lani. Maybe that's why I talk to myself so much when I'm alone! And as a writer, I can see why reading my stuff out loud helps me make sense out of all those words. Lani: Yes, we can get perspective on the stories we are creating in our heads when we say them out loud, and even more so when we hear other people's reactions to them. People can get stuck in the stories that they keep locked inside their heads, plus they convince themselves that there is only one particular meaning to their story. Life is far too complex for anyone's story to be held hostage to only one meaning. And because we're all both storytellers and story listeners, we have the potential and ability to free each other from being limited to any one meaning, especially if it is a meaning that brings us pain, limits our potential or keeps us distant from those we love. Furthermore, when we are able to find new meanings in our stories, we are using additional neural pathways in our brains. In short, by finding alternative meanings in our stories, we can continuously revise and increase our neural paths. Ultimately, healing comes from expanding our relationships to our stories, seeing how our own judgment and self-concept contained in stuck stories might have been holding us back. You've worked with so many groups with various socio-economic and cultural differences, and with marginalized people--all with extremely different judgments, self-concepts, beliefs and values. You're enormously accomplished with bringing people together through storytelling and story listening, especially to be advocates for social justice. Lani: I worked with City Mission Boston to create The Public Voice Project. Although the program was originally created to help recently released prisoners learn public speaking skills to address issues related to reforming the CORI Laws, I found that examining and telling their personal stories led to huge change and growth amongst the participants. I watched how people could be transformed by building trust over the weeks and opening to explore their more difficult stories. They wrestled with shame and self-blame to gain insight into how their past story came into being, and through that process find self-compassion and compassion for each other. They moved from seeing themselves as either victims or perpetrators, to now being the hero of their story. It was incredibly empowering and healing to own their stories and take responsibility for how they wanted to live the next chapter of their lives. Since 2004, Public Voice storytelling programs have evolved to train both men and women who have been previously incarcerated, youth at risk, homeless or victims of social inequity. Our storytelling graduates have gone on to speak to lawyers, congressman, churches and schools. The speakers are able to see firsthand how their stories can make a difference in the lives of others, or bring about change within the community through putting a human face on the issues, raising awareness and motivation to get involved in social change efforts. Some questions we explore in our storytelling groups include: Who are you in your story? What have been your challenges and obstacles? Who has helped you? What are the inner resources, skills and strengths you have relied on to get you through the hard times? How does your story guide you in your life? Does your current rendition of your story sustain you or constrain you as you try to move forward in your life? Who needs to hear your story? How can you help your audience both hear and understand your story? What changes (both internally as well as for others) would you like to see happen as a result of telling your story? By reaching out and sharing stories with the wider community, not only do participants see that they matter, but they begin to trust that they matter no matter what. You've also worked with healthcare facilities conducting storytelling workshops for providers, patients and families. Lani: I have brought my story work into several hospital settings, including Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston Medical Center, The Greater Baltimore Medical Center and most recently, the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, NY. At the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, I facilitated a story-listening workshop with chaplains, delivered a lunch time lecture on story listening for their medical personnel, as well as worked with the staff who run their Life Recorded Program which had been initially developed by Story Corp. The focus of the Life Recorded Program is to elicit and capture the stories that help patients remember who they are beyond their illness, beyond their identity as a sick person or as a sick person's caregiver. Additionally, Roswell Park supported a healing retreat for cancer survivors and their caregivers to explore their healing journey towards wellness. Over a hundred patients gathered together for a full day of story sharing. Using Joseph Campbell's hero's journey model, they shared their stories of: Who was I before I became sick? What have been some of the hardest moments and how did I get through them? Who helped me that I didn't expect? Who did I think would help, but they couldn't be there for me? What have been the external resources I have relied upon to get me through? What have been the internal resources I have discovered about myself through coping with the hardships on this journey? Who do I want to thank? Who do I need to forgive? Who do I need to ask forgiveness from? What I am grateful for? Within my workshops I encourage participants to look at their stories from all different angles, not trying to change their story, but to expand it such that it can hold more of themselves. Patient stories are about so much more than coping with illness; they are about their identity and sense of belonging in the world. Doctors and nurses are dedicated to curing disease, but healing can happen without a cure. Healing is often connected to the stories we (and others) tell about ourselves. The wonderful thing is that we have so much control over that. Whether someone is challenged by an illness, recovering from a trauma, or coping with a loss, the stories we tell about our experiences and the meaning we make of it can be the beginning of reclaiming our lives. Have you also worked with doctors? Lani: At UMass Medical Center in Worcester, I consulted with a group of physicians and researchers studying the impact of storytelling on health equity disparity (CHEIR). They were interested in exploring the ways that hearing stories of positive medical intervention could increase the trust in minority communities to engage medical help or follow through on medical recommendations. Although the researchers understood that story could be an important factor in gaining patient trust, they were in need of support to help successful patients convey their stories in a way that could captivate and inspire others. So, essentially I was hired as a story coach to teach storytelling skills to patients as well as to the physicians and researchers. These stories have since been captured on video and disseminated on radio and television throughout the community. New patients are now being screened to see if the stories they heard had an impact on their decision to pursue or follow through on medical treatment. Patient's challenges, seen through their stories of their cultural and social predicaments, not only encouraged other people struggling with symptoms to seek out medical help, but also helped doctors to communicate with their patients with more patience and empathy. One of the things that I am most excited about, is that researchers are also beginning to explore the impact of storytelling on the storyteller. What does it mean to share your story with another, knowing that it could perhaps ease their medical challenge, if not even save their life? How does that change how one feels about themselves as the storyteller? Sharing stories is not a one-way process. Both the teller and listener can benefit from the interaction. Something that's been on my mind: How does living in the digital age affect how often or how deeply we share our stories? How much do you think our digital world is affecting us? Lani: I remember that even when I was a little girl sitting at the dinner table back in the 1960s, the TV was on with the evening news blaring across the room. Media and its ability to steal attention from relationships is not something new. Over the past several decades, we've all gradually grown accustomed to letting media direct our lives, leading to distraction, multi-tasking, short attention spans. There are well-documented accounts of the rise of addiction in the indigenous populations in Alaska during the 60s and 70s when family storytelling traditions were replaced by television. As children no longer sat through long evenings listening to the stories of their elders, certain life lessons and values were no longer handed down. The effects were not felt for years, but researchers now make connections between the decline in family storytelling and loss of family cohesion. But fortunately for all of us, storytelling has been making a comeback. Not only for children, but people of all ages are being encouraged to tell their stories as well as listen to the stories of others. Story Corps and the Moth are good examples of how storytelling is re-entering our culture, leading people to take a deeper interest in listening to each other's stories as opposed to interacting with a device. One of the problems is that social media tends to lack the depth of story that nurtures us. Facebook certainly seduces us with story, but these stories are often void of depth, values, or learning, causing them to lack the nourishment that stories can give us. It's sort of like junk food--an addictive junk story to fill us for a while, but we feel hungry again very soon. Yes, Lani, I'm glad you said that a story needs depth, needs the time for the whole story to unfold. I admit it's the depth that I miss so much in my conversations these days with friends and loved ones. I just wish we had more time for sharing our stories, and finding more meaning from them--together. Lani: I hope you can advocate for making the time to share stories more deeply. I certainly will. In my work with elders as an activities specialist at assisted living communities, I'll be thinking about you when I lead discussion groups and storytelling sessions. You've already motivated me to be a better story listener--a deeper story listener. Thanks so much for your time, your generosity, and your wisdom. Four of Lani's quotes were so helpful and wise that I couldn't resist doing a quick recap of her stand-outs. These takeaways are worth savoring on their own: \"Life is far too complex for anyone's story to be held hostage to only one meaning.\" \"Healing comes from expanding our stories so we can find more than one meaning in them. We can see how our own judgment and self-concept has locked us into one meaning that might be holding us back.\" \"By reaching out to the wider community, not only do we see that we matter, but we begin to trust that we matter no matter what.\" \"When we own our story, when we are accountable for it, we don't need to isolate ourselves with it, but we can go out into the world with it. This story has helped me, and it can help you. It's not a one-way process to tell our stories.\" Lani Peterson's site Boston City Mission CHEIR at UMass Medical Center in Worcester Val Walker, MS, is the author ofThe Art of Comforting: What to Say and Do for People in Distress(Penguin/Random House, 2010).

    "data": "Segment 6 in our seriesSoul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill by Shaler McClure Wright You're listening to episode six ofSoul Chronicles,offering a soulful perspective on how to navigate the unique challenges of living with ongoing health conditions. Special thanks to Health Story Collaborative for hosting this monthly audio column. My name is Shaler McClure Wright and I'm a writer/artist living with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. Standing Watch in the Sleepless Sea Being awake at night when the world is asleep is like standing watch on a ship at sea. After a few hours of staring into the distance, you might feel isolated, fearful and uncertain if you will ever dock in a safe harbor again. Worries loom larger in the silence of darkness, just as rocks seem to rise out of nowhere. And once-familiar objects are shrouded in strange, threatening silhouettes. Many of us with chronic health conditions have sailed on the sleepless sea, and quite a few of us are frequent passengers. I've been bunkmates with insomnia for decades. When I was in my 20s and 30s it was easy to shake off a sleepless night and function pretty well the next day. But now it takes a toll, and I'm learning to treat sleeplessness with new respect, as both a worthy adversary and instructive companion. Being alone and awake in the night can be frightening. Nocturnal impressions are heightened. Even when we're old enough to put aside our childhood fears of monsters under the bed, insomnia can feel like a giant presence, smothering you with unstoppable, oppressive force. But it's also true that the mystical aspects of darkness can serve as a gateway for visualization, opening us to new and unexpected points of view. And there's a better chance of quieting our worries if we choose to walk through that gate without preconception or fear of where it might lead. Here's what I mean. These days, when I wake up in the wee hours (envious of my husband's purring-ly deep sleep), I direct my attention away from the fuzzy shadows and inward to my imagination. Then I choose to visualize a different experience of the dark, from another time. I like to choose events that have held space in my memory, but may not yet be fully understood. Most recently I chose to revisit my memories of midnight from a specific perspective-- at sea... Just after I graduated from college (a long time ago) I was invited to live and work with a family on a sailboat, as we voyaged from Finland to Sicily. During longer passages we followed a system called watch 'n watch, which means round-the-clock sailing--four hours-on, four-off--with our crew split evenly between shifts. I remember how my crewmate would wake me for the midnight-to-four [shift], whispering as she gently rocked my shoulder, \"Polaris is bright and winds are steady. But there's ground fog, so you'll be in the bow, on lookout.\" Lookout was my favorite job, especially in the mystical hours after midnight. I loved to feel the cool dampness of night against my knuckles and cheeks as I scanned the horizon for buoys and bells. But not every watch is idyllic. In foul weather, sound is distorted by ground fog. All appears quiet until something pops--all of a sudden--out of the darkness. At first it's hard to tell how far away that something is, and your emotions can run the gamut from startled to fearful to attentive. It's only in the attentive phase you can accurately make out shadows in the dark. Flotsam and jetsam float by without harm, and passing ships appear farther away than they actually are. Sound is muffled by moisture until it's upon you. Most nights the sounds of the sea are soothing, but in foul weather, there are sounds that can rattle your soul. On one particular stormy night, as we were exiting the English channel and rounding the isle of Ushant to seek shelter in Brittany, we had a force ten gale that was blowing us sideways. Our bow was caught under breaking wave after breaking wave, and our foredeck was awash with the weather. The storm was too fierce for anyone to stand in the bow, so I stayed amidship, fastening myself to the guardrail for safety. We made little headway during that storm, even with shortened sails and use of our auxiliary engine. Our 57 foot sailboat didn't have radar, so our biggest worry was about inadvertently finding ourselves in the path of a monster tanker, too large and immobile to slow down. The English Channel is a busy shipping lane with freight crossing at all hours. We could hear the tankers but couldn't see them, and it was my job to sound our air horn once every minute to make sure they could hearus. We could feel their wakes, still rolling underneath us, and we held our breath, hoping we'd never come close enough to to get sucked in by their propellers. Luckily, our horn was heard and that night the tankers passed at a safe distance. But it felt like forever before we could rest. Finally, in the wee hours of that sleepless night we made entry in the nearest port. But it was a commercial harbor, and it was full. We had no choice in the darkness but to raft our pretty white sailboat to a rusty old reddish tanker that was ten times our size. And for all we knew, it could've been one of the tankers that crossed our path in the channel, but now its immense steel hull was providing shelter to our windward side. That stormy night reminds me of my worst nights of insomnia. With no sense of how much time had passed, no sense of where I was, and no sense of what lay ahead, I felt small and powerless. The overwhelming size of the tankers felt a lot like the overwhelming force of insomnia, and their churning wakes felt a lot like the tossing and turning of a sleepless night. That storm taught me many valuable lessons. And one, unbeknownst to me until now, is worth repeating: Try to remain open to what frightens you; for the very thing you fear may become your protector, given time. Just as a tanker can change from danger to protector, imagine the experience of transforming sleeplessness into dreamfulness. For in our dreams and imagination, the desperation of insomnia can be transformed into an opportunity for self discovery. Juan Ramon Jimenez, Nobel prize-winning poet from Spain, describes the pivot point between desperation and discovery in his poem, \"Oceans\": I have a feeling that my boat has struck, down there in the depths, against a great thing. And nothing happens! Nothing...Silence...Waves... --Nothing happens? Or has everything happened, and are we standing now, quietly, in the new life? On that night of the storm I feared our boat would be struck by a 'great thing'. But instead, the 'great thing' that posed such a threat in the channel, changed its position and rested quietly, in a new place, where we would encounter it once again, from a new perspective. The final gift of that storm was coming into port, casting our lines and making fast in the dark, only to discover by daylight that we had tied up in the lee of the same tanker that could've sunk us at sea. In its worst expression, insomnia can feel like a force ten gale blowing between our sheets. And after we've been swamped under the crests of its breaking waves, the potential insights to be gained at the bow of our ship of sleeplessness may feel out of reach. But over time, if we stay present, I suggest we can trust the afterstorm to settle. And if we're lucky, we may even find ourselves basking in the guiding light of the North Star, Polaris, as we make way, with a yawn, for safety and peace. So when you're faced with sleeplessness, try to remain open to what frightens you; for the very thing you fear may become your protector, given time.

    "data": "In the two years since the Boston Marathon bombings of 2013, we have seen many amazing examples of human resiliency. We have seen the people of Boston rise up and bond together over this shared trauma, with Boston Strong our motto. And we have seen families and individuals move forward with courage in the face of loss. Powerful news media images of amputees learning to walk on their new prostheses are emblazoned in our minds. Quieter, less visible personal transformations have also occurred in many who were not physically injured by the bombs. Jennifer, a 42 years old woman who has suffered from depression for years and who was volunteering at the Boston Marathon Finish Line in 2013, describes the events of that day as \"a turning point\" in her life. In Jennifer's words, \"Since the marathon, everyday is a gift.\" She realizes how lucky she is to have walked away that day without any injuries, alive. Moreover, the events of that day, which for Jennifer included helping a runner reunite with his family in the aftermath of the explosions, changed her life goals. She now feels it is her responsibility to do something to help others and is committed to finding concrete ways to do so. In what Jennifer describes as \"an amazing coincidence\", she was signed up to participate in a Relaxation Response program at the Henry-Benson Institute of Mind-Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital the week following the marathon bombings. Primed by her marathon experience, she devoured what the course had to offer. The teachings not only deepened her sense of self-acceptance and gave her skills to manage her own depression, but also strengthened her resolve to help others, and she ultimately went on to become a peer counselor for subsequent groups. The central message she came away with is that while we cannot necessarily control what happens to us in life, we can control the meaning we make out of our experiences. She is determined to make the events of April 15, 2013 mean something, and to translate this meaning into action. As far as her depression is concerned, she has come around to recognizing \"some of the good things about depression\", namely her appreciation for the small things in life, and her increased sense of empathy for others. \"It's like any other illness\", she says. \"It doesn't have to limit you. It's all about making it mean something.\" I have so much to be thankful for. I should NOT feel so horrible. But, I did feel horrible. Lost. Lonely. Exhausted. Often. I was a sophomore in college. 18 years old. I had spent several nights crying, not knowing how to get rid of the dull ache I felt inside of me. Now I was on my way to an intake session at the University Counseling Center, at the suggestion of my best friend. I had tried my best to hide my sadness, but having struggled herself, she saw right through me. I skipped my history class to make this appointment, trading time in a class I enjoyed for an hour that was one of the scariest of my young life. I sat in the corner of a slightly dim room with a box of Kleenex in one hand, sobbing and spilling out my inner emotions to a woman I had never met. After 45 minutes of listening, she suggested regular counseling. An appointment was made for the next day. I was so terrified that I almost called it off, but I knew I had to be brave, so I showed up the next day and weekly thereafter. It seemed to be helping, but then, after the third week of counseling, one of my closest friends seemed to turn on me without explaining why. He just shut me out. Suddenly. I was mad, confused, and hurt, not sure if I wanted to go on. I cried so much in therapy that afternoon--all I felt was despair. I could only imagine that he stopped being my friend because I was so messed up. Too much of a burden. I was still the nerdy bookworm I had been in high school, but being at the university had opened my mind to new ideas, people, music, art, and lifestyles. It was exciting but at times overwhelming. I was a perfectionist, not satisfied with any grade lower than an A. As an Honors Program student, I was constantly surrounded by overachievers like me. By the time I entered counseling, I had pushed myself harder academically and emotionally than ever, so hard that I bottomed out. Nothing I did felt good enough. Slowly, over months, my counselor helped me to see and appreciate who I was becoming. Things would be OK, I thought. Things were OK, at least for the rest of my undergrad years, but anxiety and depression were never too far away. I went on to grad school, still never feeling good enough. As the first in my family to graduate from college and pursue an advanced degree, I constantly compared myself to fellow students who went to better schools and came from families with more wealth and status. I was afraid I would be \"found out\" as the fraud I assumed I was. Every night, as I tried to go to sleep, my mind would swirl with thoughts of all the things I could have done differently, better, often reliving mistakes made years earlier. I often wished that I would fall asleep and never wake up. There was also a lot of good happening in my life during graduate school. I fell in love and got married. I had a job that I enjoyed. But still, even when things were going well, I knew that eventually, depression would find me. It felt inevitable. I was in my late 20s when I first discussed my depression with my primary care physician, and she suggested I try an antidepressant. In my mind, this marked for me the moment of my \"official\" diagnosis of depression, even though the feelings had been longstanding. Now that I had been labeled with major depression, I had the comfort of a diagnosis and potential treatment, but also a fear that I was now associated with a condition that carried a great deal of stigma. How was this stuff going to change me? Could it really work? Would I need it for the rest of my life? Did needing antidepressants to function mean that I was too weak to deal with problems on my own? The first two weeks on Wellbutrin were difficult. I felt like someone had turned up the volume in my brain. I had trouble sleeping. Every so often I involuntarily twitched. I was afraid to tell the doctor. What if she took me off of the meds and I lost this opportunity to maybe get better? And then, about two weeks later, the buzzing in my head stopped. One morning I woke up and everything felt \"even,\" as I came to describe it. The internal criticism stopped. I could fall asleep and started sleeping a little more soundly. It felt like a miracle. I finished my Ph.D. two weeks before my thirty-second birthday. Before I knew it, I had been offered what I long described as my dream job, and my husband and I moved to Boston. Everything about every day was new and exciting. I was happier than I thought I had any right to be. I was gliding. But not for long. Depression continued to haunt me as I spent time in and out of therapy, on and off medications, feeling okay and not okay. My last serious relapse in 2011-2012 was the scariest. I would often cry riding the train to work, wiping the tears from my face, trying not to call attention to myself. When I couldn't take the pain any longer, I started therapy again, got my meds changed, and again, began to work toward feeling more even-keeled, but it took much longer this time. Sometimes I just wanted to disappear from the earth. I came home one night, curled into a ball on the ceramic tile of my bathroom and behind that closed door shaking and sobbing as quietly as I could so that I would not scare my husband. Although I was generally quite open about talking to my family members about my depression, more often I felt the need to hide my pain. They did their best to support me and I did not blame them if at times they felt helpless. At the same time, I felt guilty for causing them to worry, broken because I could not seem to get better, and exhausted from living in a world I felt was filled with more pain than I could bear. In early 2013, I decided I needed to find a new approach to managing my recurring depression. Although my symptoms had subsided thanks to regular therapy and medication, I feared another relapse, and I didn't want more or different medications. Before moving to New England, I had a regular tai chi practice and was experimenting with mindfulness and meditation, both of which had helped me deal with the stress that tended to trigger depressive episodes. My search for similar experiences and training led me to the Benson Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. I signed up for an eight-week session to learn the Relaxation Response that would begin on April 16, 2013. The day before the program was scheduled to start was a sunny Patriot's Day morning. I arrived in Boston at the time I would normally have arrived for work, but instead made my way to my volunteer assignment for the Boston Marathon. I had been volunteering at the race since my first year in Boston. As a recreational runner myself, it is a great way to support the running community, and something I am always honored to be part of. This year I would be working at the first water stop after the finish line. I was ready for a long day on my feet, first turning the caps on the water bottles to make them easier for the runners to open, and then handing them out with a smile and congratulations as runners moved through the stretch along Boylston Street after finishing. I was surprised at how physically beat up many of them looked--some encrusted with sweat or bleeding in spots where they had been chaffed by clothing. Faces winced as legs hobbled slowly forward, a situation I could relate to only too clearly, having finished the Chicago Marathon about six months before. Some runners were in better shape and had the smiles I expected to see. Just being there to help these runners was a very emotional experience for me as I shared with them all the joy and pain of finishing 26.2 miles. Hours passed. I watched the numbers on the runners' bibs get higher, indicating that we were getting deeper into the field of over 25,000 participants. My feet and lower back started to hurt from prolonged standing. I remember looking at a clock on a Boylston Street building that read 2:00 pm. My anticipated check out time was still 4 hours away. At 2:50 pm, as I was looking down Boylston Street toward the finish, I heard an explosion, followed by a plume of smoke, then another explosion. Fireworks, I wondered? The runners continued down the stretch and because I was so used to seeing battered bodies, I could not tell from their faces what had happened. And I was afraid to ask. Then I saw a female runner coming toward us with a look of horror on her face. Soon, the emergency vehicles began screaming down Boylston Street toward the finish, an area that was now a cloud of smoke and blinking lights from emergency vehicles. In a world where news and information are available almost immediately, there was a void--no one knew what was going on. Speculations and rumors spread. Then, one of the first responders asked us to clear the area. They were looking for a third unexploded bomb. All I remember is a sense of unreality as the scene unfolded around me. I wanted to help but was afraid to help at the same time. No one knew where to go but someone told us to go to the Fairmount Copley Hotel, located on the other side of the Square. I cut through Copley Square, running behind the big white medical tent to the corner across from Huntington Avenue. The hotel was in lock-down. Emergency personnel was pushing people on stretchers toward waiting ambulances. At 3:20, the first of many text messages started arriving from friends and family, those near and far. Where was I? Was I OK? A volunteer wearing one of the white jackets designating her as medical staff approached me with a man in a wheelchair, a thin but very fit middle-aged man, with sandy brown hair and a beard. Michael. He was shivering in his thin runner's singlet and shorts and was desperate to get his gear bag back, which contained warm clothes. The medical staff had been treating him for stress fractures after he crossed the finish line. He did not have a phone - could one of us text his wife to let her know where he was and that he was OK? Then Michael and I were alone. I sent the text \"I am with Michael - he is OK - are you OK?\" I still don't know if that message ever made it to her. I'm not sure how long we waited at that corner across from the medical tent but at some point, I decided I needed to do something, to take action and make sure that Michael reconnected with his family. I decided to wheel him to the family meeting area and try to find his gear bag so he would have some warm clothes and his cell phone. For such a lean runner, he was much harder to push than I expected. As we came to the end of the block, there was a rough spot in the curb cut. I hit it with a thud, knocking Michael forward and practically out of the chair. He reacted with an expression of pain. Until then I had managed to keep my emotions in check, for the most part, but now I started to cry and my hands began to shake. \"I am so sorry,\" I told him, and I was. All of a sudden, I realized where I was, what had happened, and what I was doing ... Now Michael comforted me. I needed to take my mind off of what was immediately happening, so I asked Michael to describe his wife to me. \"She has brown hair. She's beautiful, and she should be wearing a brown coat,\" he said. We got to the family meeting area but she was not there. My heart sank. I told Michael I would not leave him until he was back with his family. In the meantime, I would retrieve his gear bag. Amazingly, not only did I find the school bus that had brought his bag back to Boston but the volunteers actually gave it to me to take to him. I returned to the meeting area and was overjoyed to find Michael's wife standing next to him. When he saw me carrying his bag, Michael exclaimed, \"My angel!\" His wife and I needed no words of greeting as we reached out to one another to hug, sobbing with relief, for what seemed like a long time. When I was certain that there was no more I could do to help Michael and his wife, we said goodbye. I wandered from Back Bay to my office on Cambridge Street in a state of shock, stopping regularly to respond to a steady flow of text messages coming from friends, family, and coworkers. As I opened the door at my workplace and saw one of my coworkers at reception, I let out a series of sobs that shook me to the core. Everyone who was in the building at the time came down to the lobby to see me, hug me. I called my husband. My supervisor drove me home. All I could do was crawl into bed. Not surprisingly, the Benson Henry program did not start the next day as scheduled. There was too much uncertainty about travel in the city. The people responsible for the bombing were still at large. By the time the program started, one week later, I had spent seven days feeling completely numb, going through the motions of life. I can hardly remember it. But I still remember the first guided meditation in the program clearly, a body scan, and how good it felt to finally find some brief moments of peace in my own body. The next seven weeks brought more meditation experiences, opportunities to share the impact of these practices with the group and to listen to the stories of others who had sought this program for a whole variety of reasons. The most valuable part of the program for me was learning to recognize cognitive distortion and negative automatic thoughts and to reframe them in positive and constructive ways. The many years of \"should,\" statements, all-or-nothing thinking, perfectionism, and other unproductive ways of thinking, slowly dissipated. I was extremely sad when the program ended, so I was thrilled when the group leader asked if I would consider helping the next group as a peer counselor. Participating in the program again, in a different role, was perhaps even more enlightening for me. Now that I wasn't focusing as much on myself, I was able to see how profoundly these practices impacted others. In addition to learning how to meditate, I was also motivated to restart my tai chi practice, and eventually, pursue a teacher training program at a local studio. My relationship with depression began to change. As part of the Benson Henry program, we talked often about gratitude and making meaning. I had always been careful not to take things for granted, but after the Marathon Bombing, every day felt like a gift. I had walked away from the scene with my life and my limbs when others were not so fortunate. I was determined to find some way to bring some good out of this tragic event. If that day was going to change my life, it was going to change it in the very best way possible. For the first time in my life, depression was not a hurdle to overcome, but part of me that I needed to accept, for better or worse. By acknowledging it and realizing how much the associated pain contributed to my capacity for kindness and empathy, I have been able to better cope with the occasional \"funks,\" none of which have escalated into the relapses I previously experienced. Feeling gratitude is key to helping me understand and accept depression as part of what makes me the unique person that I am. I began longing for new and meaningful challenges, opportunities to further explore and understand my own health and wellbeing, and the chance to improve the lives of others. I had a nearly 20-year career as a historian behind me and was our household's primary wage earner. The decision to go back to school to study nutrition and public health was both the easiest and most difficult decision I have ever made. But I had to do something. I often thought about Michael. At first, I had been so afraid to take charge of the situation, but I did. I met that fear and it changed me. I made a difference. I could do it again. In May I will graduate from Tufts University with a dual degree in nutrition communication and public health. I have been befriended and supported by a community of scholars and researchers who have given me extraordinary opportunities to learn and grow. I am excited to see what comes next. I am truly blessed. I have SO much to be thankful for. And I feel wonderful.

    "data": "By Rita Thompson Three redheads in a square box on wheels travel into the city with a siren announcing their urgency. I'm the one strapped to a gurney in the back of the ambulance. Back at the local hospital where we were initially introduced, I thought I was seeing double until my mother confirmed they were in fact two separate people, identical twins. She smiled at the men with tangerine-colored hair and told me she and my father would meet me at the next hospital I'm being transferred to. I'd never had an Uber ride with two drivers before, so I wondered if this was the hospital's version of luxury. If so, how many drivers would Stephen Colbert get? As we cruise down the highway, I hear the twin with more finely tufted hair call back to me. Do you want us to turn on the radio? Any station you want. I bet the twins listen to the same type of music my brother does. Bands called Garage Sale and Not Your Neighbor's Grandmother, or something like that. I scan my mind for what radio station would best suit the mood of a hospital transfer. I don't have the energy for hip-hop or the emotional bandwidth for classical. I might consider oldies, but I didn't anticipate this emergency so I don't have the number of that station memorized. No, thanks. My awareness comes back to the straps holding me down on the gurney. Are they supposed to be like a seat belt? I realize how strange it is to be facing backwards in a vehicle. Is it more safe for me to be facing this direction if we get in a crash, or is it just more convenient for the twins to take me in and out of the ambulance this way? Maybe if we got in a head-on collision I'm less likely to be slingshotted out the windshield this way. If the twins were slingshotted out of the ambulance, I'd have to David Blaine my way out of these straps holding me in place. I'd been steadily losing my ability to stand up without debilitating dizziness for the last year, and then earlier tonight at my birthday dinner half of my face went numb. I could panic, but I'm clinging to the emotional steadiness of my sanity. I know with my body in this questionable condition, my biggest asset is my mind. After the twins finish their pleasantries with me, they commiserate about the Bruins' disappointing performance this season. I'm taken aback by their hard pivot to a barbarian sport, but this jaunt is probably mundane for them. Hayes is better because he is a local guy. Canadians have better training. No one has what it takes more than a Dorchester guy. I wiggle my face to see if I've gained feeling in it. I haven't. I try not to give into the cascade of fear I'm experiencing when I could be educating myself. I know nothing about professional hockey, and I don't want this ride to be a waste of time. Hayes is from Dorchester, I etch into my mind. Maybe I'll be more useful at trivia nights after this trip. I've always been particularly uninterested in trivia, but consistently willing to attend for the appetizers and ambiance. The twin's banter turns to white noise as I wonder if my parents will find me since this circumstance is new to all of us. I don't have my phone with me, or my pants for that matter, so they will have to navigate the maze of emergency rooms in the Boston medical playground. With five massive hospitals in the same vicinity, I hope they remember I'm in the Beth Israel system and not the Brigham system. My attention comes back to the foggy rays of light shining from cars passing by. They remind me of my childhood and riding in the back of my mother's cherry red volkswagen. It was a treat to get the back seat when my older siblings didn't call dibs, especially with a plastic baggie of dry cheerios to munch on. I remember thinking it was so grown up of me to sit that far away from my mother in the car. I established the distance by pretending not to hear her when she asked me how it was going back there. When I was 5 years old, this view I see now was a privilege. While I'm not exactly itching to be closer to the twins, I want greater proximity to my mother and the opportunity to tell her how I am doing. The headlights of other cars passing by are implicit of the darkness inside my chariot. What else has happened in this ambulance? Have the twins needed to save someone's life in here? Were they successful? Panic rabbit hole. I snap my mind back into focus to stave off fearful tears. My therapist once told me that her actress-turned-rabbi sister claimed singing is a good way to interrupt a brewing panic attack. It's unclear to me how judgy the twins are, but I'm not in the position to be choosy about coping mechanisms. I allow one my favorite vocally skilled divas to become my muse. Carrie Underwood. Her chorus starts as a hum and turns into a breathy voiced melody. My voice gets bigger and I soak in the paradox of feeling so alive in an unrecognizably fragile body trapped in a mobile chamber. Are you sure you don't want us to turn on the radio? I decline. I need to feel music more than I need to hear it. It would be cool if the cars passing by could hear my voice instead of the siren. I want to be as loud as one of those vans that drives around Manhattan asking the public if they love Jesus. I guess that's one worse place I could be right now. At least I'm not strapped to a gurney in the back of a Jesus van. One of the twins calls back to me that we are nearing the new hospital. My lullabying voice fades away to the loud silence of what comes next.

    "data": "By Michael Robin This story is a sequel to Robin's previous story: \"Healing my Broken Story: Rising from the Ashes\" I meet with Dr. Sharif on February 14, 2024. On this day, he tells me that I am in the very early stages of Parkinson's Disease. Because I've never smoked cigarettes and haven't had a drink for years, I'm told it's unlikely that I will experience the worst of Parkinson's symptoms for at least ten years, if not longer. The first minute of our conversation grabs my attention. The moment I hear the word \"Parkinson's,\" I immediately think of my beloved PJ. We met on April 10, 2019, and we have a mutual commitment that whatever the circumstances, one will care for the other until death do us part. Being loved by PJ means everything to me, and I feel especially grateful for her in the moment of my diagnosis. I know that I will never be left alone as long as I live. We are two imperfect people who are perfect for each other. My sorrows soften knowing that I will not die alone and unloved. I have no doubt that PJ will do whatever is necessary to ease my burdens, as I will for her. Two weeks after my diagnosis, I receive a note from Victor Klimoski, a poet and dear friend. Victor writes, \"I am sorry to hear about the diagnosis but not surprised at your reaction to it. Like your encounter with suicide, you look beyond the crisis presented to the light that can be found. I know that capacity is fueled by your deep inner journey but that it also draws fire from PJ's love. Lucky, blessed, you.\" On Being Disabled As Victor notes, Parkinson's is not my first encounter with illness. On November 27, 2013, I survived my first and only suicide attempt I was 63 years old, unemployed, without savings or resources, in a long-term loveless marriage. At age 74, I now have Parkinson's Disease and am officially mentally and physically disabled. My status is certified by my disabled parking placard. As I dwell in the bittersweet world of growing older, I reject the idea that having Mild Cognitive Impairment with Parkinson's Disease, Benign Positional Vertigo (BPV), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) makes me any less intelligent, compassionate, or worthy of being taken seriously. While getting older, I rely on the accumulated wisdom of experience to guide me on my road home. Ours is a culture that often devalues the contributions of older people like myself, who have much to offer in terms of care, compassion, mentorship, and friendship. Living with physical and cognitive disabilities - weakening muscles, lack of stamina, increasing fatigue - does not mean I am no longer productive, dignified, and worthy. That I am diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment does not mean that I am significantly cognitively impaired, nor does it mean I am imminently dying. Given my age and all that I've been through does not mean that I should expect to function in the exact same ways I've always functioned. It does mean modifying my habitual ways of doing things. I walk slower and need more sleep. My memory and focus are not what they used to be. To maintain my balance, I walk with a cane. While I am more accepting of the constraints of age, I am more appreciative of what the eminent philosopher, Joseph Campbell called the \"rapture of being alive.\" With PJ's help, I am learning to accept that my mind and body work differently than they once did. Parkinson's has shifted the way I see, think, feel, and move. I have lapses in memory, recall, and attention. I get headaches and lose focus. I have an unsteady gait and difficulty with balance and coordination. And yet, I feel strongly that these \"impairments\" are not markers of my competence, intelligence, or moral worth. In some ways, I feel my self-understanding and social awareness has deepened since the onset of Parkinson's symptoms. On Writing For the last ten years, I've been writing my spiritual memoir titled,From Despair to Gratitude: Healing My Broken Story. I have been studying the literature of narrative psychology for many years. This began early in my career as a clinical social worker. I feelcalledto write about what it means to live my last years as a disabled person, along with living in the aftermath of a suicide attempt. While living with mild cognitive impairment, I am proud to say, I have not yet lost the distinctive quality of my words. My publisher tells me I have a unique and rare ability to write from a phenomenological, lived experience perspective of what it's like to livethroughsuicidal despair and chronic illness. Although I will continue to have problems with dysfluency and syntax, I will never disavow my words. I may stutter or drop words, but I do so without shame and regret. I will forever be revising my writing and my story. I am trying to complete an enigmatic story about how I survived a serious suicide attempt and its aftermath, by giving a soulful account of my life. Sometimes, I externalize my story by asking, \"What is my story trying to tell me?\" The paradox of writing is that the story itself never stands still. Like a river, it is always on the move, endlessly transforming itself. A story that stagnates in still waters is a story that loses its vitality. My story, like my embodied self, needs to be nurtured by a cool mist and flowing waters. As a writer, I hope my readers will be attentive to the explicit and implicit questions I raise. In the beginning, I focused on the external causes of my distress, but as my journey progresses, I become more reflective about my inner life, and how all of my experiences affect my emotional and spiritual well-being. The desire to know myself, to understand what happened, how to heal, and how to live a life worth living, has been the fuel that drives me to write. After ten years, I have been able to process a lot of what happened by remembering it, telling stories about it, probing it, and revising what I write. On this journey, I imagine myself floating on a moving river, never staying in the same place for very long. As I move through awakenings to new beginnings, I emerge as a person with a renewed sense of self. Jewish people call this processtzimtzum,the transition from divine emptiness to the womb of becoming. It's in these liminal periods that new dimensions of myself emerge. As I come to the limits of the possible, I appreciate what I have accomplished. I live with disabilities that have an uncertain course. I've lost the ability to walk fast and my pace is far less steady. The cane I carry is a ubiquitous symbol of my disability but it does allow me to live a more balanced life. The deference I'm shown when trying to open a door is heartwarming. When I walk into a room, I feel a frisson of awareness, that my presence is noted. Yet, I cannot say that my physical strength and intellectual acumen are not waning. I can no longer walk without the support of my cane. In time, I likely will need to transfer to a walker, and maybe later, a wheelchair. As my bones ache, I tire easily. It is hard to get through a day without an afternoon nap. To have Parkinson's does not mean I have no future. Despite some of these challenges, I want to live at least another decade before I pass from this earth. I am inspired by the example of Michael J. Fox, who has lived a very productive life since first being diagnosed with Parkinson's more than thirty years ago. I know that my remaining years will be full of meaning and purpose if I continue to transform memories of loss to memories of meaning. Loss often involves a release of attachment for how things used to be. There are only a few people who remain in my life from before my suicide attempt. Losing my job on June 11, 2013 was the proximate catalyst that transformed my life. Since then, I have been forever changing myself. Now, after ten years of writing and reflection, immersed in PJ's love, Richard's therapeutic support, and the friendship of writing companions, Victor, Sam, and Kiely, I know who I am. This is my story, how my attempting, surviving, and writing about a suicide attempt has been a catalyst for spiritual change that has helped me embrace my disabled self. In the coming months and years, I will continue to share my story. Above all else, I am grateful to be alive.

    "data": "By Brett Swanlund I've always been an active person and someone who likes a challenge. Growing up I played a wide variety of sports, never much of an all-star but always a great role player. Skiing, snowboarding, basketball. One pick-up basketball game in my early thirties, I missed about 6-8 wide open shots or layups. Frustrated with myself, I asked \"Damn why can't I get any shots to fall?! \"An opponent, one of the more talented ball players on the court, laughed at me. With a smug, arrogant grin he said ''Because you have no ball control\". I guess that was all I needed to get my head in the game. The next game, I hit every shot I took and scored 12 of my teams 21 points. I promptly left after that because I knew I wasn't going to top that performance. At the age of 29, I enrolled myself in Shorin-ryu classes. In a world filled with Hollywood theatrics and impractical styles it was refreshing to find something richly steeped in historical Okinawan karate tradition. Statistics show that 1/100 students reach their first-degree black belt but only 1/1000 reach their second degree. Three years ago, I was just a few months away from my 3rd. My career started when I decided to leave college after a year and a half at Plymouth State University in NH. In my youth, I had been told that a college degree is necessary to get ahead in this world, but school wasn't for me. I wanted to make a living working with my hands. I went to work for a small mom and pop plumbing and heating company, but soon ended up working for the National Grid Gas Company. It was exciting and meaningful work. I didn't mind working in single digit temperatures, jack hammering through 3 feet of frost, or the oppressively hot summer days. There is nothing quite as exhilarating as 60-90 pounds of gas pressure blowing in your face while wearing a fire suit and full-face respirator. I loved being outside everyday all day, busting balls with my crew. My coworkers used to bust me up because on the average summer day I'd sweat so much that I'd go through 3 shirts. They'd say \"your wife must hate you with that much laundry.\" My wife always said my laundry would break the washer because my pockets were always filled with dirt and pebbles from working in a trench. I'll have you know that the washer works just fine to this day. I was about 6 months away from being a crew leader before my accident. Not everyone out there truly loves their job but I did, and having that taken away from me was a bitter pill to swallow. At my core, I am a family man. My beautiful wife Jennifer is the strongest, most supportive, and loving partner and I am blessed to navigate this life with her. I met Jennifer 21 years ago in the dingy basement of my fraternity across the beer pong table. It almost pains me to admit that she beat me, but we'll chalk that up to the two extra semesters of practice she had on me. This year we will be celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary, but we've been together for more than half our lives. We've built quite a life together and have two wonderful children Logan who is 11 and Kayla who is 8. On June 9th, 2020, life as I knew it changed forever. At the height of the pandemic, I found myself going a bit stir crazy. The only social interaction I had was with my coworkers. My dojo was shut so I spent most afternoons after work running on the treadmill and lifting weights at home. Once spring rolled around a friend suggested I take up mountain biking with him. I really enjoyed it, as it got me outside with people. On that day in June, I met my friends Zack and Dan after work in my hometown of North Kingstown, RI to hit the mountain biking trails. The ride was enjoyable, and everything was going great, until it wasn't. My friends were a bit ahead of me and as I crested a small hill, looking up at them in the distance, suddenly my front tire dropped, and I went over the handlebars. I was pile driven into the ground. I never lost consciousness but as I lay face down in the dirt, I knew instantly that I was gravely injured. I immediately told my friend Zack not to move me. He dug out a little hole under my mouth and gave me water. My friend Dan called 911 and rode out to a nearby parking lot to meet the paramedics and lead them to me. The paramedics put me in a neck brace and on a board and carried me through the woods to the ambulance. Looking up at the green canopy above me, I was less concerned for myself than I was worried that my selfish desire to go mountain biking had put the wellbeing and stability of my household in jeopardy. My wife immediately ran to the hospital but was not allowed in the ER because of COVID. Finally, a nice nurse snuck her in. I apologized profusely through tears, and in the most loving way possible she basically said shut up and assured me I did nothing wrong. My first week in the ICU is a haze because I was heavily sedated. My injury had left me a C8 quadriplegic. I also spilt my C1 vertebrae in half but luckily it did not hit my spinal cord at this level, so they put a bracket around it and fused my neck from C3 to T2. They also performed a tracheotomy because I had trouble breathing on my own and put a feeding tube into my stomach. I vaguely remember the first time I FaceTimed with my wife. I couldn't talk and could barely move my arms, let alone grip a marker with grip tape to write. Luckily, one of the nurses was good at lip reading. Once I left the hospital and went to Spaulding rehab, they pulled the trache and feeding tube and I was able to eat, and more importantly drink on my own. I was also becoming much more functional with my hands which made things much better. Visitors were restricted because of COVID. The hardest part by far was not seeing my children, but once, a few weeks in, I was allowed to visit with them in a conference room. I was still weak, in a power chair, but tears of joy came to me instantly. They both climbed into my lap and hugged me as tight as they could. They told me how much they missed me and how much they loved me and I told them the same. Seeing them gave me bit of motivation to stay strong and keep fighting. I vowed to persevere and make them proud of me, without them there is no story to tell. I really hit the jackpot with the staff who were assigned to me at the rehab. The two most impactful were my physical therapist, Gillian, and my occupational therapist, Nicole. I won't divulge which one dropped me on my head the first week, but I was fine and as she claimed it builds character. At a time when I was extremely isolated, they were the only people I had to talk to and confide in. We basically laughed through every session. Though of course I had my grumpy and mopey days, they made it fun. Nicole was always the sympathetic ear, assuring me that there was still so much I could do and accomplish, like driving and adaptive sports. At the time, I rolled my eyes and didn't believe her. She is wise beyond her years. Gillian and I had a lot in common, both being close in age, and our love for 80's and 90's music. She was truly my comic relief, usually at her expense. I had several hiccups while at Spaulding, including frequent UTIs and C Diff, but I never missed a session even though these things weakened me greatly. I'm pretty sure one session I completely fell asleep while Nicole was stretching and massaging my hands. I always had candy in my room. One day Gillian witnessed me take a handful of skittles and was appalled I didn't separate them into flavors. This resulted in a weeklong poll amongst patients and hospital staff on how to eat skittles. I won and Gillian's punishment was to eat a handful of all the flavors at once, probably one of the most hilarious and dramatic moments in Spaulding history. As my discharge date approached, Nicole mentioned to Gillian that I'd be fun to have drinks with. When the day came, we exchanged numbers. A month later, Jennifer and I met Gillian and Nicole for dinner and drinks after and appointment. After that, we started doing monthly FaceTime cocktail hours. I'd update them on what I was doing, they'd help me find resources and we'd just laugh and enjoy each other's company. For my one-year anniversary, they planned a surprise party with Jennifer. It meant so much to me. When they were leaving, my brother thanked them and commented that it was remarkable how much they cared for their patients. They told him I was the only patient who had ever warranted such an occasion. This revelation turned me into a sobbing mess. I was so happy. They had to be my therapists, but they chose to be my friend and that meant the world to me. Before I came home, my family worked tirelessly to prepare my house. My mother and friend Barry from college started a GoFundMe to help with the exorbitant costs of making my house accessible. I was truly humbled by the amount of support I received. My parents, wife and brother had my bathroom completely redone, had a ramp installed and many other things to make life easier. My brother and his girlfriend Caroline came to the house all the time to play with the kids and to keep Jenn's spirits up. The adjustment to coming home was difficult. My spasticity ramped up and I suffered UTIs frequently. I was also battling with a lot of self-doubt and anxiety over how life was going to be. I worried that there would be no place for me back at work now that I had been stripped of the physical attributes that had helped me build a career. I had crippling anxiety thinking I wouldn't be able to provide for my family and I worried I would never again have a reason to feel proud or accomplished. Some days, I just wouldn't get out of bed. Being home alone while the kids were at school and Jenn was working was hard. My thoughts went to dark places, and I often ended up crying by myself. But then I started going to SCI Boston zoom meetings and it was a relief. I spent at least the first four meetings in tears. At the very first one, I shared that I was worried about how my kids would perceive me and if they'd be embarrassed by me. The group assured me that they would become my biggest helpers and would love me even more knowing they could've lost me. They weren't wrong. Logan leads with his \"can do\" attitude. Every time I lament not being able to help him physically with sports or karate, he tells me that we will find a way, and we do. And Kayla is my little helper. When we go grocery shopping, she pushes the cart and, because we are both vertically challenged, she climbs up on my lap in the chair to grab items out of reach. My kids never cease to amaze me. I soon decided that sitting around feeling sorry for myself was counter-productive and that I was going to do everything I could to experience all life has to offer. I decided to show my kids that even though life can be cruel and throw curveballs, it's how you respond that defines who you are. I started going to an adaptive gym a well as outpatient physical therapy and worked out multiple times a week, usually getting rides from my parents or friends. This inspired me to begin adaptive driving lessons, so that I could drive myself places and help transport the kids. My father built me a countertop at my height, and I started cooking family meals. Once I got back on the road that March with an adaptive van the fundraisers helped me purchase, I wasn't going to let anything stop me. While the kids were still in school, I was constantly signing up for adaptive sports with Spaulding. I did everything, tennis, kayaking, cycling, mountain biking, archery and I even discovered there was a way to golf again. What made all these new experiences more rewarding was having someone in a similar situation to share them with. A few months after I had been home, I was at physical therapy and a young woman named Faith rolled in. At the time, I was the only wheelchair user in this time slot, so it was nice to see someone else in my situation. At first, we didn't talk much but one day, while leaving, her casters got caught in a crack at the bottom of the ramp and sent her flying out onto the wet snow. My dad helped her back into her chair. To my surprise, she showed up to the newly injured group two days later. Little did I know that it would result in an unbreakable bond and truly special friendship. We're separated by approximately 10 vertebrae and a whopping 18 years. That spring, we both volunteered to work with physical therapy students at the University of Rhode Island. As the only wheelchair users, we were in a room by ourselves joking around and basically competing with one another the whole time. Our relationship is a bit unconventional because if it weren't for our paralysis when else would you see an almost forty-year-old man hanging out with a young lady barely into her twenties? But let's be honest, conventional is boring. We have so much more in common than the chair. We both love being active and aren't afraid to try new things, we share the same twisted sense of humor and an uncanny ability read each other's minds. Whenever we're in a large group and no matter what the topic of discussion, we just look at each other and know we're thinking the same thing and laugh. We've done so much together--mountain biking, dozens of golf outings, even wheelchair football. She even loaned me her smart drive while mine was being repaired. I guess I'm lucky her parents always taught her to take care of the \"elderly\" as she put it. Seeing all that she does, being a full-time student and working part-time, really inspired me to pursue my return to the workforce more aggressively. She's like the little sister I never had, though she never passes up an opportunity to remind me I'm old enough to be her father. The last leg of my journey has been returning to work. I've had the benefit of working for the National Grid Gas Company for the last 14 years. You may not like their rates, but they are a wonderful company to work for who values the knowledge and experience of their employees. And no, I don't get a discount. Finally, after a lot of hard work and persistence, I returned to work on December 1, 2022. This was the thing I had wanted most since my injury, to be able to once again provide for my family and make everyone proud. It's been a bit of a learning curve going from a trench in the street to a desk in an office, but I'm learning quickly. I also have the benefit of seeing my former coworkers every day. Going forward, I will always strive to make my family and friends proud of me. I will never let this chair define who I am. I believe with the right mindset you can find ways to overcome physical limitations. I often reflect on the words of retired Navy Seal David Goggins, who always preaches mind over matter and mental toughness: \"It won't always go your way,\" he said. \"Don't focus on what you think you deserve. Take aim on what you are willing to earn\". Simply surviving a hardship allows you to continue but in an impaired state. Recovering from a hardship sends you back to your baseline, meaning no progress has been made. To thrive, you have to learn from that hardship. I'd like to think that I have learned a lot and will continue to learn.",

    "data": "Health Story Collaborativehosts cool events where patients of all kinds get to tell their stories. I spoke at one event, and afterward, I walked on air and could feel a change in the vibration of my body. Following my magnificent experience, I was honored to host one of these discussions in my home for a woman named Liz who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. I didn't know Liz - she was recommended by Health Story Collaborative - but she and her friends had wonderful energy and sharing her story in that way was as powerful for her as mine was for me. Though Liz and I had much in common (similar in age, children of the same age, attitudes toward life, cancer diagnosis....), we didn't stay in touch. Life gets busy, we all have our routines, you have to prioritize your limited energy during treatments, and we each have plenty of friends we already don't get to see as often as we would like. This week, I actively wondered about Liz and how she was doing. I didn't even remember her last name to try and find her email address in my list of contacts, and contacting Health Story Collaborative to find her felt like adding another thing on my list of things to do, so I didn't follow through. Liz's well-being remained an unanswered question. In the meantime, here is how my chemo holiday has progressing. First and foremost - I love not doing chemo! I love being free from tubes, I love not carrying vomit bags with me everywhere, and I love having a clearer mind. I love having more than two weeks each month when I can do things that one needs and wants to do in life (grocery shop, hair and dentist appointments, kids' school events, etc.). Occasionally, I think about my CT scan results. The doctors saw some fluid near the anastomosis (surgical connection of two parts of my intestines that aren't normally connected). The fluid can be simply nothing or it could mean that the Avastin (which has been working so well for me) may be doing damage to the stitching there. If there is damage, it is inoperable, and a tear in that area would likely be fatal. And not instantly fatal - it would more likely involve a long hospital stay and decline. For the record, that is not my preferred way to die. So if that were the case, that would mean no more Avastin. I generally don't look ahead; I mostly assume we will handle whatever comes up when it arises. But when I think about this particular potential conversation with my doctor, I do remind myself that if Avastin is no longer an option, I am lucky to have other options when it comes to chemo drugs. There is another drug, Erbitux, that many friends have taken and one friend is currently taking with successful results. The most notable side effect is a major skin reaction. It looks like you have acne or a red rash all over your body, which is usually uncomfortable. Given how sensitive my skin is on a good day (for example, I have to watch what kind of Band-Aid I use, or which tape they use on my skin at the hospital), I fear that my skin will be especially sensitive to this drug. Besides that, it is unsightly. I kind of like not \"looking\" like a cancer patient. Mostly, I try to stay focused on the present. Admittedly, that is easier to do when I am feeling well. The snow is gone and while it has been chilly, the sun is starting to shine, so that helps. However, I've also had many days filled with pain that make it hard to move or even stand, and nights where the pain keeps me from sleeping. Strung back-to-back for over a week, these days feel endless and discouraging. I realized that I rely on living my life from miracle to miracle and I wasn't noticing anything miraculous popping up, so that was bringing me down as well. During that time, I did what I could. I booked more acupuncture. Tom Tam loaned me this device to wear to help with my pain. (I was skeptical, but it truly helped enough to get me up and moving.) I scheduled regular bodywork appointments with a local guru. I resumed calls with my energy worker. I did a reiki session that enabled me to sleep. I read funny novels and watched comedy clips on YouTube. I reframed any negative thoughts that made their way into my psyche. Absentmindedly deleting junk emails this week, I noticed one about a new drug approved by the FDA,ramucirumab (brand name Cyramza(r))targeted for stage 4 cancer patients. It works similarly to Erbitux but with different side effects. Ah, a potential option if I need it. Thank you God. I felt myself exhale. Then, I went into Dana-Farber for a port flush. (They need to periodically access the port in my chest and flush it with saline to keep it clear and useful.) I signed in and the woman behind the counter gave me the plastic bracelet with my name, birthdate, and medical ID number. I hate that bracelet and all that it stands for. The port flush went well and, immediately afterwards, I walked through the waiting room, straight to the trash can, and pulled the plastic bracelet off my wrist. As I held it over the trash can, a woman stopped and said to me, \"You might not....\" Immediately defensive thoughts went flying through my mind, such as,Don't tell me that I might not want to throw this away. Don't tell me that I might need this for discounted parking. I just want to be rid of this thing... Thankfully, she couldn't hear my thoughts, so she continued on, uninterrupted (as far as she knew), \"...remember me. I did a talk at your house....\" OH MY GOSH. It was LIZ! I just LOVE it when questions are answered. I didn't know where to start reconnecting with her - there were so many places to begin! Well, we were both alive, which seems to be everyone's first question about cancer patients. She looked good and energetic and still had the cynical edge that made me laugh. She was back on chemo and today was a treatment day. We talked about parenting through treatments and taking care of ourselves and living with one foot on the path of \"I will heal\" and the other on the path of \"What if I don't.\" We talked about Kripalu. We talked about Tong Ren and Tom Tam and, in that crowded waiting room, I lifted my shirt to show her the device he developed that helps me with pain. (You should know that lifting my shirt also exposes my colostomy bag, but that paled against my excitement of seeing her and sharing something that might help. Besides, in that room, people are dealing with issues larger than the horror of glimpsing someone else's colostomy bag.) Running into Liz at that place and time was like a Divine Intervention. She told me that she really needed to see me at that moment, and I couldn't explain how lifted I was to see her. It helped to restore my faith in the connectedness and purpose of the universe. Her presence helped me to feel like God was listening to my questions and would provide the answers if I can just be patient. We exchanged email addresses again and while I am not sure how we will stay in touch, I know that our hearts are connected enough to bring us together and inspire each other as we move forward. Thank you for always being there to inspire and support me. I appreciate your prayers as much if not even more during this break, as it can be scary and painful but also, bearable, with your friendship and support. Blessings and love and miracles,Mari",

    "data": "Change is inevitable, but it's how we choose to deal with that change that determines who we are as people. Health is something that we take for granted. Because we never fully understand its value until it's gone, it often isn't until we suffer some form of physical or mental breakdown that we realize just how valuable it is. But, sometimes, when we lose something so treasured, something much better is found. For me, when I lost my health, what I gained was a journey into discovering who I really am. I transformed into a person that I didn't know existed, and this made me redefine myself. In my youth, I was an avid snowboarder, skateboarder, weightlifter, paint-baller, and rock climber. But, of all the sports I loved, volleyball was my muse. I thought that I would play it forever. I racked up numerous medals in the high school, regional, and varsity circuits. I attended nationals in club volleyball, and snagged a silver and bronze medal in provincial beach volleyball tournaments. I loved it. With plans of becoming a police officer, I found myself finishing university with dreams of my next steps. A partner, a big house, a fancy car, and then maybe some cute babies---all those picture perfect things we all aim for. I thought that life was in the palm of my hand. Little did I know, sometimes things don't last forever. It started with annoying muscle cramps, and then progressed to debilitating gastrointestinal, immunological, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms. I plead my case to over 15 specialists and had over 100 vials of blood drawn. No answers. After years of searching, I started to wonder if the doctors were right that nothing was wrong, that perhaps it was all in my head. But then, a neurologist from Hamilton's Neuromuscular Clinic in Canada decided to take a closer look. My intuitions were validated as I was finally diagnosed with a rare disorder calledIsaac's syndrome, orimmune-mediated neuromytonia. Everything that I had previously envisioned about my life was gone. The volleyball. The fancy car. The policing career. All of it. Because of my health problems, I was pushed to the limit and forced to adapt to new limitations and reinvent the story of my life. Now, I've grown into someone who is completely different than the person I used to be. Before, I was a jock who was insecure no matter how low my percentage of body fat was or how dark my tan was. I was desperate for attention, I was impatient, and I was a know-it-all. Looking back, I knew nothing. \"Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet.\" -Aristotle Before my diagnosis, things came easily for me. Sports, school and relationships all came effortlessly in my life. Because of this, I naively thought that getting answers to my medical questions would be the same. I thought that they would come quickly. If not, obviously, the first doctor I consulted would set his entire life aside in order to figure them out; that didn't happen. It took me a long time to adapt to my situation. I learned that when your back is up against the wall, and there is nowhere to run, you learn to work with what you have, even if all you have is patience. Some goals and dreams will come quickly and others may require a tremendous amount of persistence. And, that's ok. There is no race to the finish line. Life's most triumphant moments may take a while to manifest. Patience became the foundation of my journey. It was the lesson that came first, and gave me the strength and courage to accept the lessons that came next. It allowed me to endure a decade of emotional and physical struggles---rejection, failure, loneliness, and most importantly, symptomatic struggles. I learned that I could become someone that others could rely on. Instead of always receiving help from others, I was finally able to give back. I had the ability to give the greatest gift of all to people around me: my time and energy. \"It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.\" -Confucius I believe that the learning curve in life is the same as the learning curve in sports. You start slowly, get a little bit of movement, but then fall down, and have to get back up again. At times, it was hard to keep going when everyone told me that I was fine. But, I remained patient and remembered that sometimes the biggest breakthrough will come when we're on the verge of giving up. It's not fair to quit based on what we think will happen. We have to keep searching for answers. Looking back, I remember the devastation I felt after each negative blood test and each consultation that left questions unanswered. But, now I know that there was always forward movement. One doctor led to the next. One negative test set up another. Even if years went by without tangible improvements, I was still always moving forward. Every step, whether positive or negative, is the result of all your previous steps. Maybe it won't come in a week, a month, or a year, but sooner or later, you will eventually find what you're looking for. \"Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle.\" -Plato The more I moved away from the person that I used to be, the farther I ventured into the unknown. I realized that I was becoming more aware of those around me. The more I felt my own darkness and pain, the stronger my compassion for others became. I felt for people in similar situations and understood what it was to be chronically ill without answers. I realized that life wasn't just about me. Everyone has problems. Everyone has battles you know nothing about. Feeling this new sense of compassion, I understood that even the doctors that dismissed me were doing the best that they could. Just like in volleyball, these people became part of my team. \"Healing is a matter of time, but it is sometimes also a matter of opportunity.\" - Hippocrates Early in my illness, I was very attached to the reality I had constructed. I was like a child who clutched his toys and cried when they were taken away. When I lost my health, I lost my identity. Letting go is a part of life, and the sooner you're able to, the sooner another part of your journey will begin. The day I realized that I would never be able to play volleyball again was the first time I fully understood the true scale of my loss. I had lost the love of my life. The changes in my life were involuntary, and made me understand the power of surrender. Being forced into submission, but also still consumed with the need to push for answers, I was no longer under the influence of my egotistical desires. I became more peaceful with my thoughts---more loving and more understanding. Our struggles are really here to guide us somewhere else. Each step of my journey was full of challenges, but I realize that I was unknowingly on an expedition of self-awareness and improvement. Although I lost many things along the way---a stable income, athletic talents and the freedom to do what I want---I gained something much more valuable: peace of mind. I became conscious of myself and I feel extremely blessed that I was able to go through something so transformative while having the ability to become someone I truly admire. Regardless of what you're going through, I can confidently say that life has a way of getting us to where we need to be---both spiritually and physically. We just need to believe that it's never the ending; it's always the beginning. This piece appeared on \"The Good Men Project\" website in September, 2015. Hailing from Ontario, Canada, I was diagnosed with autoimmune Neuromytonia, or Isaac's Syndrome, after graduating from the University of Guelph.

    "data": "By Doretha (Dee) Burrell It all started in January 2007 after having yearly mammograms as usual, but for some reason, this particular mammogram came back abnormal. I was on vacation in Cancun, Mexico when I received the call that I had breast cancer. My first thought was \"You have to be kidding me. I am 50 years old.\" Sometimes we have no idea why things happen to us, but I have learned through my journey of battling breast cancer to simply not even ask the question, \"WHY?\" Some things we simply do not have control over, so we must roll with the punches, as they say. Going through cancer was tough, and to make matters even worse, as I was battling cancer, my mother was also diagnosed with cancer, and she passed away. I felt like I had been hit with a double whammy. My treatment consisted of surgery (lumpectomy), chemotherapy, radiation, and two full years of participating in a clinical drug trial, all in the hopes that my cancer would not return. I experienced FULL hair loss - it was weird to be totally bald, but thank goodness, as a former model, I knew how to change hair styles by using wigs! It was not too devastating wearing a wig on my bald head. I honestly believe having the experience of changing the hair styles so often actually saved me from going through severe depression when I did lose my hair. Fast forward 14 years, and I am living cancer free, but cancer has changed my life significantly. First and foremost, it has changed the way I think about myself. I actually learned to LOVE myself. After battling breast cancer, I began to see a whole new me...a strong, beautiful, courageous lady who realized on the journey of treatment, surgery, and the emotional ups and downs how important life is and how to be grateful for each and every day that I am blessed to live. I no longer hold on to anything or anybody that is not adding joy in my life. Letting go is one of the toughest things to do, but it was essential for me to take time to clean house, so to speak. I noticed I was no longer hesitant of ending bad friendships, bad jobs, and folks that did not treat me the way I want to be treated. I also realized my spirituality keeps me uplifted, and perhaps it was there all along, I just never stopped to appreciate it. I love life and have accepted the good as well as the bad. Recently, I became certified as a life coach to help bring out the hidden treasures in others, so they can acknowledge their gifts within themselves. Life is so different for me now. I don't have a problem of stepping outside my comfort zone....so much so, that after working 20 plus years in a professional career, I am now working part-time as a host at a waterfront restaurant! I have never worked in a restaurant before, and here I am in my sixties with my neatly coordinated outfits and heels welcoming guests and escorting them to their table to enjoy a lovely dining experience. Ladies, you know how it is trying to be stylish, but sometimes those heels can get the best of us! My first week working at the restaurant, I wasn't even sure if I were going to be able to get out of bed each day and walk...whew! I am sure I have purchased every bag of Epsom salt in a three-mile radius of my home to take soothing, muscle relieving baths. As time passes, I am finally actually enjoying the host job. I have learned to meditate, slow down, accept life as it is right now, and keep on striving and thriving. I am doing things that I have never done before cancer and I look forward to seeing where this journey will take me. Trust me...had I not battled cancer and have the opportunity to enjoy a second chance in life, I would not be stepping outside of the box and my comfort zone. So, YES! My illness has changed my life forever! Doretha (Dee) Burrell Dee is internationally recognized as a Certified Diversity Consultant with special emphasis in Women's Issues, Certified Life Coach, Public Speaker, breast cancer advocate, published author and she has earned her Competent Communicator (CC) pin and title with Toastmasters. She is a breast cancer survivor, and credits her daughter Andrea and granddaughter Jayla with keeping her happy and full of zest for life.",

    "data": "All of our Healing Story Sessions are videotaped, and some of our participants have courageously agreed to have their videos shared on our website. Here, you can watch Marie share her story of living with Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer. Marie participated in our first Healing Story Session in March, 2014. Her story is humbling, moving, and funny. She has amazing perspective, wisdom and a terrific sense of humor. It is worth a watch! As mother to two young boys who love to watch movies, certain lyrics tend to run through my head, likeChitty Chitty Bang Bang we love you!orYou've got a friend in me....from Toy Story. Since my most recent cancer diagnosis, the lyrics that stick in my mind are from Frosty the Snowman: Frosty the SnowmanKnew the sun was hot that dayBut he said let's run and we'll have some funNow, before I melt away.... I was initially diagnosed with colorectal cancer when my sons were 1 and 4 years old. At that time, we put our lives on hold for an entire school year while I had surgery to remove part of my colon followed by chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. Our lives revolved around my healing, and any treatment that might make me well again -- like acupuncture or sleep -- took priority. While I missed doing many activities with the kids, my husband and I decided that the trade-off would be worth it in the long run. After nine months, I completed chemotherapy. There was no sign of cancer, and I returned to living my life. Like many people, being diagnosed with cancer shifted my view on what was important, and I swore that I would never again take life for granted. But one of the beautiful things about living life as a healthy person is that you do get to take it for granted. So, as I returned to health, I also returned to doing all the things that I swore I would never do again. I became easily annoyed with other drivers, got impatient with the kids, juggled too many commitments, and spent time doing things out of obligation rather than joy. Still, this made life feel comfortable and normal, and there seemed to be security in that. Of course, security is an illusion, and almost a year later, we saw the first signs that the cancer had returned. Like a lot of bad news, it was delivered over the phone. Though the doctor primarily called to have me repeat a blood test, the request gave me an ominous feel in the pit of my stomach. I hung up the phone and sat in the kitchen, looking out the window at my boys, now almost three and six years old, playing in the backyard. It was a warm spring day in late May, they were running and laughing, and I realized that, more than anything, I wanted their life to continue that way. I also realized that I wanted a planter on our back deck, and now seemed like as good a time as any to get it. I called the boys- we were going on an adventure! They were excited and we drove to the best plant store I knew. I wandered around the enormous planters while the boys amused themselves playing in the water fountains. At first, I tried to keep them out of the fountains, but the sales folks didn't seem to mind, so I let it go. By the time I made my purchases, the laughter was bubbling out of their bodies and water was dripping from their clothes. As we got everything into the car, the boys stripped down for a naked ride home and the saleswoman commented that I was the calmest mother she's ever met. We had a truly beautiful day in spite of the news, and I remember that triumph every time I look at that planter. The rest of our summer and fall days were filled with ultrasounds, blood tests and surgeries. I had one 2 1/2 hour surgery to remove and rebuild my entire rectal area, followed a few months later by a 7 1/2 hour surgery to remove it all again. This surgery included a full hysterectomy to remove a large tumor growing on an ovary and touching every other abdominal body part, and the surgeon removed parts of the fat in my abdomen where there was evidence of more tumor growth. Doctors at MGH and at Sloan Kettering told me that both the surgery and the chemotherapy regimen would need go 100% to have a chance of long-term survival. In the last surgery, there was tumor left behind, and we learned that cancer cells were in my abdominal fluid. So we had more work to do. Only three weeks after that surgery, I started a regimen of chemotherapy every other week. This requires a full day at the hospital having an infusion. Then I go home carrying a continuous infusion pump attached to my chest for two days. The pump comes in a black bag containing chemotherapy; an IV line runs from the bag to a port-a-cath in my chest. Not only does the chemotherapy taste awful and remind me that I am a cancer patient, but it affects how I sleep as I try to keep the line from tangling, and how I shower, because I can't get the apparatus wet. The kids know that they need to be careful around my body, and I worry that they are less spontaneous with their affection as a result. I wish I could count down to the end of the treatments, but the doctors soberly recommended no end date. Though I am trying every complementary treatment I can to get off chemo, it sounded like this would be our way of life for the foreseeable future. I knew that I couldn't put my life on hold to heal; this IS my life. It took a few weeks for me to accept this hated reality and the scariness of an uncertain future. I wanted to put the whole package back on the shelf and select a different path for myself and my family. Slowly, the reality settled in and, while I still resisted it, I gradually tried to view it as a gift. I had time, I was able to be home and not in the hospital, and, other than cancer, I was in good shape physically and had a life I mostly loved. I started to look outside myself. I couldn't imagine what this experience would be like for my sons. What could I do to help them navigate terrain that few adults are equipped to manage? Determined to provide my boys with joy and laughter and - if my health took a bad turn, with happy memories of us all together -- I started my mission to \"have some fun.\" This is easier said than done, of course, particularly when the feeling of illness can permeate your life and be part of your household and psyche. One night, I vomited every few minutes for six hours (even though I had taken the anti-nausea drugs that day). My husband was out of town, and my mother was staying with us. I couldn't stop long enough to get her help, and she couldn't hear me call her. Eventually, my three-year-old son woke up and found me in the bathroom. It makes me both proud and sad that he calmly walked to find his grandmother to help with the situation. It's hard to think about \"fun\" when I must unexpectedly miss a school assembly I hoped to attend or a movie that we all planned to see together. It is now a way of life that the kids accept, but saddens me as I watch them go off without me. As I see them walk away, I wonder if this is what their future will look like, and whether I will get to be part of it. So, how could we have fun in the midst of all this? How could we have a household that is not permeated by illness, but is instead light and joyful? Between all the cancer treatments, I was lucky enough to have a series of good days and we ran with them. In a one-month period we took the Polar Express Ride in New Hampshire, celebrated Christmas with extended family in Pittsburgh, went skiing for a week in Stowe, VT, and took a long weekend trip to Disney World. My husband and I traveled to New York (to see doctors at Sloan Kettering) and managed to make that into a mini-vacation with a shopping trip to Bloomingdale's and a delicious Indian dinner. In my quest to make the most of my time with the boys, I can push us all too far. In my son's first-grade classroom, they tapped trees for maple syrup and processed it. Given his excitement about this, I decided that we would go maple sugaring one weekend. I packed the kids into the car and drove 40 minutes to take an hour-long tour, followed by hot dogs. At the end of the adventure, my six-year-old told me, \"That wasn't worth the long drive, Mom. We learned all that at school already, and the hot dogs weren't very good.\" So I am learning to balance these trips with doing simple, everyday things, like riding bikes, playing restaurant and hunting for rabbits in our back yard. It is hard to know what would be memorable, and how to make the most of every day. I still have moments, even days, when I am not up to activity or even conversation. At those times, I try to remind myself that tomorrow might be worse, and that will make today look like a good day. So I'd better get up and repeat my mantra, the simple lyrics from Frosty the Snowman:We'll have some fun now...

    "data": "In April 2014, Sue Levy shared her story of living with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare, progressive and potentially fatal lung disease. Now, she shares her story of navigating infertility, a journey that started years before, but ultimately was informed by, herLAM diagnosis. Sue, now 37 and married with two young daughters ages 18 months and four years, underwent six unsuccessful cycles of IVF before she and her husband decided to explore alternative ways to have children. They initially pursued domestic adoption but ultimately decided on egg donor and gestational carrier. A couple is deemed \"infertile\" when they are unable to conceive after one full year of unprotected sex. In the U.S., approximately 11% of women 15-44 years of age have a difficult time getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term, according to the CDC. While the use of Assisted Reproductive Technology is much more common today than it once was, the term \"infertile\" is still fraught with negative connotations, especially for women. Dealing with infertility can bring up feelings of shame, failure and loss. Today, Sue can honestly say that her inability to get pregnant was a blessing, in part because her lung condition is estrogen responsive and can worsen in pregnancy, but mostly because she cannot imagine having any other children than the ones she has now. Her story reminds us that although our plans don't always unfold as we had hoped, we can find unexpected joy and beauty along the way if we open ourselves up to the possibilities.

    "data": "By Val Walker Image Credit: Phillip Justin Mamelic For the Healing Through Wonder Project, I explore stories of people who deeply believe in the power of wonder for living with grief, trauma, and addiction. I've personally found inspiration and hope from their recollections of how moments of awe and wonder transformed their lives and sparked their faith in humanity. I've met contributing storytellers for this project through referrals from the following three organizations in the Boston area: The Sun Will Rise Foundation: The Sun Will Rise Foundation provides peer grief support for those who have experienced the death of someone they care about due to causes related to substance use. SADOD (Support After a Death by Overdose): SADOD is dedicated to increasing the effectiveness of peer grief support in Massachusetts for people affected by a death from substance use (not only from overdose but also from suicide, homicide, accident, and medical complications due to drug use). The Health Story Collaborative:Thanks to a referral from Annie Brewster, MD, who collaborated with Unfixed Media founder, Kimberly Warren, to produce a video series calledThe Unfixed Mind: Navigating Mental Health Today(2023), I met an enthusiastic participant from this series, Ricky Allen. He was pleased to share his story with the Healing Through Wonder Project. Having been profoundly transformed by a moment of awe and wonder, Ricky generously provided interviews for this project via our lively Zoom conversations. His story echoes remarkable similarities to the awe and wonder experiences of other storytelling participants. Broadly speaking, based on neuroscience research, common responses to awe are: Shifting focus from our headspace (our self-referential, nagging thoughts) to what is outside of ourselves--to the present moment Self-transcendence and opening to a new perspective Being a part of something vast and much greater than ourselves Feeling grounded and calmer in our bodies Time slowing down or standing still Seeing others in a new light and interest in helping others Ricky's experience of a life-changing moment of awe reflects these robust benefits to our well-being and mental health. In his following story, we can learn how even one brief moment of awe and wonder can provide a source of resilience for a lifetime. Ricky Allen: The Life-changing Kindness of a Stranger Ricky Allen, 32, is an inspirational speaker and mental health peer mentor who has presented for NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) in Austin, Texas. Ricky was raised by Christian missionaries in an African American household in Missouri City, a suburb of Houston, Texas. Proud to be helpful as the oldest of three children, he watched over his siblings as the \"man of the house\" while his father worked long hours as a plumber. \"Even though we were a low-income household in those years, we were a loving, resourceful family, and our parents took good care of us. I had lots of neighborhood friends who played in our house with me and my brother and sister.\" When Ricky was in the third grade, after the family had relocated to Lubbock Texas, he faced racism and bullying in his school, but thankfully football became a stabilizing and positive force in his life. \"Fortunately, as a big kid for my age, I was introduced to football. Being on that team and playing as a lineman helped me deal with the racist attitudes at the school. But it was also a good outlet for me to express myself. Sports helped me learn to regulate my emotions and handle stress.\" Later in 2003, the family relocated again to San Angelo when Ricky was twelve. He continued to succeed at football and enjoyed his school friends who came to his home to play video games. These were happy and social years. \"My friends came from all walks of life. We really had a good time playing Halo on game nights...I kept playing football and still loved it.\" Unfortunately, due to an injury to his left shoulder by the age of sixteen, Ricky was forced to stop playing football. Losing the opportunity to play his beloved sport caused him to become isolated, bored, and depressed. His grades plummeted, and he barely kept up with his classes, as he stayed home playing video games and gaining weight. Ricky remembers his first schizophrenia symptoms--hearing voices and hallucinations--appearing when he was alone at home. \"I heard voices--and I was not in control. I first noticed a voice talking to me when I was alone in the backyard at my house. It said, 'It's a beautiful day.' I answered out loud, 'Yes, it is.' I will never forget that first time talking with my first voice.\" Soon, feeling paranoid about his symptoms becoming evident to others, he tried his best to hide them. But it was difficult for him to focus on assignments in his classroom or chat with family members during meals. \"I became paranoid and kept worrying that someone was going to find out about my voices and put me in a mental hospital somewhere. I was afraid people in white coats would lock me up, like I had seen in the movies.\" Ricky's friends and classmates joined him in increasing drug and alcohol use. Although he received his high school diploma, he admits he had lost interest in starting a career and felt ashamed of his lack of focus or ambition. His symptoms progressively caused him to withdraw socially, and he could only handle part-time retail jobs. \"I worked at Dollar General and Target--a lot of jobs. I even worked as my father's apprentice as a plumber...I was really going through the wringer and getting progressively more depressed and isolated. I started self-mutilation, cutting myself on my arms and feeling a lot of shame.\" At this time, Ricky had not been evaluated or diagnosed, so, sadly, he was not aware he had schizophrenia-- and he had no context for identifying his symptoms which frightened him. But he struggled to put himself, as he describes, into \"autopilot.\" Music became his favorite remedy for anxiety and depression. He especially enjoyed songs from the 1970s, from Earth, Wind, and Fire. One winter night in 2012, he heard the shocking news of the suicide of one of his closest friends. Ricky did not eat or sleep for forty-eight hours in his acute grief over his friend's death. He heard nagging inner voices urging him to drive immediately to his friend's gravesite in San Angelo. He dashed into his car at midnight and drove 220 miles to his friend's gravesite, arriving at the cemetery. \"But the gate was locked--the gate would not budge. I could not get through to go see my friend's grave. I was so upset. I sat in my car for hours and saw hallucinations all around me.\" Deciding to visit his friend's parents, despite his anguish and exhaustion, he pushed ahead to drive a few miles on the interstate in heavy morning traffic. But soon he blacked out and found himself in the middle of a car crash. \"Four eighteen-wheelers flew past me. Somehow I had skidded off the highway and I could see a jeep, pulled over in the left lane, that had been rear-ended by my car. Smoke was coming out of the hood of my car. I was in shock.\" Ricky was frozen and stunned, sitting in his car. A middle-aged woman with blond hair, wearing a gray sweatshirt and jeans, stepped out of the jeep and walked over to his car with a caring look of concern for him. He felt terrible guilt for hitting her car and could hardly look her in the eyes. \"She asked me, 'Are you okay?'...She wanted to calm me down, just by standing by me, caring for me, as if she was my mother. She said, 'The ambulance is on the way.' I could not talk but I could see she knew I was in shock.\" Ricky was briefly evaluated by the EMS workers from the ambulance that soon arrived, but he signed a waiver not to go to the hospital. He remembers that the woman returned to her jeep and waited and watched the EMS workers before she left, making sure he had been evaluated and was safe. He believes she never told him her name. Ricky drove back to Austin, despite the damage to his car, and amazingly, he managed to reach his home safely. Later that day, he realized how profoundly moved he was by the woman's kindness and gentle care for him. He believed a miracle had happened at this time in his life amid his illness and grief. He reflected on her words 'Are you okay?' and realized how vital it was to take responsibility for himself, and that his self-care was part of caring for others. It was time to be honest with his family and ask for help. \"She gave me a second chance. She gave me a gift. She could easily have pressed charges. She didn't even file a claim. She didn't judge me or care what kind of background I had. She only wanted to help.\" On the same day of the accident, Ricky told his parents about his ordeal with hearing voices, seeing hallucinations, the suicide of his friend, and the demolition of the car. \"I told themeverything--I completely opened up. I felt I should come clean to my family after that amazing miracle happened to me with a stranger on the highway.\" Soon Ricky was evaluated at a psychiatric hospital, diagnosed with schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and was prescribed medications. His parents became active members of a support group for families as well as mental health advocates through NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) at his local Austin chapter. \"My parents and siblings are glad to be connected with NAMI. They wanted support and education to learn more about schizophrenia and how they could support me. I'm so relieved and grateful they became involved.\" Thankful for the support from his family, his peers, his local community, NAMI, and other mental health providers, Ricky moved forward with a genuine sense of commitment to his recovery. But it was his miraculous connection with the woman in the accident that inspired him to take responsibility for his recovery. He believes he was given a second chance by her act of kindness, lifting him out of his shame and isolation caused by stigma about his illness and substance use. This healing encounter with this woman has also motivated him to serve others by putting his second chance into action. His mission is to show others who live with mental illness how to find hope, meaning, and purpose in their recovery. Between 2016 and 2019, Ricky earned an associate's degree in creative writing at Austin Community College. During that time, he was awarded a certificate by NAMI for being a presenter for their series \"In Our Own Voice: Living with Mental Illness.\" Ricky currently works full-time as a peer mentor for a community services agency in Austin, helping other young adults live with a mental illness. \"I tell everyone that I think it is a miracle that I am still here. The woman in the accident who asked, 'Are you okay?' has inspired my work. When I check in with people, I ask, 'Are you okay?' every day. I carry on her message of kindness and caring.\" In one video forThe Unfixed Mindseries, Ricky movingly describes the moment when a parent of someone he had mentored expressed their appreciation for his work and called him a hero. With tears of gratitude and humility, he recognized how he had truly given someone who suffered like him a second chance. When I last spoke with Ricky this past January, he offered his insight in honor of the kind stranger who gave him a second chance. \"People need people in their lives to care enough to ask, 'Are you okay?' To be open and honest. Showing we care, human to human, can save a life.\" Resources and Further Reading For more about Ricky and theUnfixed Mindseries, find on YouTube: Unfixed Mind: Living with Mental Health Challenges Unfixed Mind -- unfixed Healing Through Wonder Project About the Author Val Walker is a contributing blogger forPsychology Todayand the author of400 Friends and No One to Call, released in 2020 with Central Recovery Press.

    "data": "Storytelling seems like a strange topic for adaylong eventin the middle ofHubweek, a weeklong celebration of \"innovation at the intersection of science, art, and technology\" in Boston. Innovation implies novelty or discovery, but storytelling is ageless: we are, after all, narrative creatures, hard-wired to tell stories. The panel discussion duringStorytelling and the Future of Medicine--the concluding session of Hubweek's Medical Storytelling event--focused on defining why storytelling in medicine is natural as it is innovative. FeaturingJon Adler, PhD,Annie Brewster, MD, andSuzanne Koven, MD, and moderated byWBURreporterRachel Zimmerman, the panel reflected on medicine's (re)turn to its narrative roots. Despite our narrative nature, modern medical practice has minimized intimacy of caregiving and storytelling. To an extent, modern technology has dehumanized medicine and, in its turn, muffled the patient's voice. Clockwork appointments leave little time for interpersonal exchange. Diagnostic technology lets the body speak for itself. As a result, patients feel dissatisfied and isolated, and caregivers burn out. While medicine and storytelling are staged as opposites, their relationship is complementary and vital: health and healing are possible only at their intersection. Where the medical institution has established boundaries or binaries, Dr. Adler, Dr. Brewster, and Dr. Koven have all found remarkable overlap. Dr. Adler, who studies narrative psychology and identity formation, spoke about the ways stories influence our sense of self. Storytelling puts both routine and extraordinary life events into context. Our life stories are mutable: we are constantly contextualizing and re-contextualizing our lives. Mental health is thus intimately tied to the way we frame our stories and make sense of our their high points and low points. Dr. Brewster's work as an internist and as founder of Health Story Collaborative are rooted in her interest in human connection. As a patient with Multiple Sclerosis and a medical provider deeply interested in the stories of her patients, Dr. Brewster understands the power of listening and being present. Illness and health challenges are isolating and frightening, and stories can provide moments of connection and relief in the face of such incoherence. The listener is as crucial as the teller precisely because the listener is able to accompany the teller, to be present when everything else seems to fall away. For Dr. Koven, Writer in Residence at Massachusetts General Hospital, medicine and writing were not always two intertwined pursuits. Although she is a lifelong reader and writer, Dr. Koven was trained to separate her two passions. Her view was transformed as she recognized the resemblance between writing and healing and storytelling and clinical practice: stories were key to understanding and caring for patients. What's more stories give caregivers the opportunity to make sense of their experiences in the rushed and fragmented circumstances of modern medicine. For all three, to understand the achievements of modern medicine is to understand its shortcomings. Medical advances have come at the cost of human connection and storytelling, and patients and physicians alike have expressed their dissatisfaction at the structure of modern medicine. Dr. Adler, Dr. Brewster, Dr. Koven, and Ms. Zimmerman refuse to settle for medicine's isolation and thus turn to storytelling as the necessary solution. For each, their return to storytelling is as radical as it is natural.",

    "data": "By Kate Breck It's 2AM and I'm up for the third time since finally passing out at midnight. My spine, hips and arms are on fire and feel like they are in a vice. The muscle relaxer I took to put me to sleep can only do so much. I have severe chronic pain due to three autoimmune disorders. Mornings are the worst, as it is exceedingly difficult to move due to the pain, stiffness and never-ending fatigue, but I push through as I rush to get my daughter and myself ready for the day. As I struggle to get ready; every little movement brings more pain and by the time we are ready to go, I am wanting to get right back into bed. Some days I do not think I can continue moving, and I want to give up on life entirely. These are the moments when I remind myself that I am happier now, than I've ever been before. While the pain is near intolerable, it's nothing compared to the pain I experienced throughout my childhood. Growing up as a little girl, I spent my entire adolescence wishing for one thing: a happy family. The kind that doesn't hit, scream, or demean. The kind of family that doesn't make you instantly cry as you step off the school bus because you know what hellish nightmare awaits you. I had given up hope at a young age that I would ever attain this dream. The endless cycle of abuse was bound to continue. I was certain I wasn't going to make it to 18, anyway. I had no plan for adulthood, because why plan for something you will never obtain? I was wrong. Not only did I end up making it to 18, but I created an escape plan. I worked 60 hours a week cleaning vacation homes, mansions, camps, basically any building I could find, because that was all I was qualified to do. Every day while scrubbing toilets, I would dream about no longer having to clean 14 houses in 12 hours. I wanted a desk job more than anything. One day, one of my clients took a chance on me and gave me my first office job. This position led to another job, which eventually got me into healthcare, which I was always interested in. Those years I walked two miles to and from work, rarely had anything in the fridge, and even went some winters without heat, but at least I didn't have to break my back and hands cleaning houses anymore. Even then I struggled to find myself and still didn't value my life.When I was 21, I met a guy. He had the same sick sense of humor as I did, and - little did I know - he was battling his own inner demons. The first time we spoke, it felt like I had known him all my life. Still, I told myself there was no way I was going to be in a relationship. I wasn't wired for that, and it wasn't worth the pain. He had similar thoughts, and we decided it was best that way.Again, I was dead wrong. Our relationship was off before either of us knew what was happening. In the back of my mind, I asked: how I could allow myself to trust someone like this? What was I doing? I'm not supposed to get married or have children. I don't know how to have a healthy relationship, let alone raise another human being. I'm not even remotely equipped...but why can't I picture myself without him? Why did he have to ruin my plans of eternal solitude where I would never again have to rely on someone else or allow them to let me down? Against my own judgement, I decided to take a chance on him, and myself. A couple of rough years passed, and we got married. One year later, our daughter was born.Finally, for once, I was right. We struggled as young couples do, but we also were two kids with a lot of trauma that was never unpacked - a recipe for disaster. We worked opposite shifts for many years so that one of us would always be home with our daughter, which meant we were barely making it mentally and financially. Shortly after having our daughter, I was in severe pain constantly and extremely fatigued. Every joint, bone and muscle in my body hurt in a way I hadn't ever known was possible. I honestly thought I was dying. Starting when I was 25, I saw many doctors and had so many tests done with no explanation. I was 29 when I was finally diagnosed with an autoimmune disease seronegative rheumatoid arthritis which ended up turning more into a psoriatic arthritis diagnosis. Most recently, lupus has been considered as well. I believe these autoimmune diseases came to be partly because of genetics but also due to the traumas I faced at a young age. There has been research that childhood trauma can be a trigger for many people with autoimmune diseases, and as a parent this scares me. I can't stop genetics from passing these diseases to my daughter. Every time she loses balance or has a pain in her legs or arms my heart drops and I instantly picture her going through the same struggles I face. The one thing I can do, is to make sure she doesn't face the same struggles I faced as a child. My husband and I give her the safe home and stable household that we never had. If my diseases have taught me anything; it's how important love and stability are. Since my diagnosis, I've had about 15 orthopedic surgeries, hundreds of infusions, injections, staph infections, influenza several times that almost killed me, shingles, Covid-19, and countless other ailments due to being on immunosuppressants. As if that wasn't enough, my husband has his own health struggles physically and mentally, and so does our daughter. Throughout all of this, we somehow worked our way up at both of our jobs and on my 34th birthday in 2020 we finally did something we had been actively trying to do and dreaming about the past decade. We purchased not only a house, but our DREAM house. It's been over a year now since we moved in, yet we still find ourselves waking up almost every day and asking each other if this is a dream. How did two once lost souls get here? Perseverance? Stubbornness? Luck? I'm sure there are plenty of people that wouldn't understand how something as basic as a house and a functional family could be considered \"making it\", but for us it is everything. I'm still not sure how nearly 14 years have gone by since that day two dysfunctional souls met, but I constantly think about how much everything would be different if neither of us took a chance on life. I truly believe we could have easily ended up dead or in prison. Even worse, I'm afraid we even could have repeated our families' mistakes and continued the cycle of abuse and neglect. The odds have always been against us, individually and together, but I'm grateful to be able to say that my wish came true. I broke the cycle and I now have that happy family I once wished for so long ago as a little girl, and I will never take them or my life for granted again. My declining health and the relentless progression of these diseases cannot keep me down, because my dreams have already come true.

    "data": "I was sorting through the sea of email, when I saw the Epilepsy Foundation of New England's posting in purple and black font: Epilepsy Support Group Beyond Medication: A Discussion about Surgery. Though my seizures had been under control for almost three years, I still reviewed the foundation's notifications. I noticed immediately that all the panelists were medical practitioners. There were no patients on the panel, and I felt indignant about this oversight. They needed a patient in the room - somebody who chose surgery as an epilepsy-treatment option, who could answer patients' questions firsthand. I felt compelled to be that person, and avail myself to whomever showed up, so I registered, lined up childcare, and marked my calendar. The event was held on a damp evening last spring. I took the subway to the Charles Street stop. As I navigated the streets in front of Mass General Hospital, I observed the traffic controller directing the EMT's parking the incoming ambulances. I was struck by the sheer number of personnel required to deal with each traumatic predicament. As I watched, I was immediately brought back to the day I required emergency brain surgery: I had been rushed to this very place, where a neurosurgeon on call performed the operation. I thanked my lucky stars that day was almost three years behind me. Now I was at MGH by choice, on my own terms.The panel was held in a cramped nearly windowless conference room. I settled into a chair, and looked around the table. The MGH doctors were easy to spot in their standard white coats, and I recognized the third doctor from the Epilepsy Foundation's website. The fourth practitioner was the nurse who was leading the meeting. The patient turnout was even smaller than I expected: There were four of us, one patient for each presenter. We each introduced ourselves and I learned that every patient in the room had already had elective brain surgery to try to control seizures. (So much for my good intentions of sharing the scoop on surgery with somebody who was on the fence.) The nurse gave a PowerPoint presentation, complemented by a three dimensional plastic model of the brain. She passed the molding around, and explained the basics about seizures and brain surgery, acknowledging that everybody in the room probably already knew a lot of this information. I suspected she was more disappointed than I was. The attendees' demographics were varied - we represented different races, genders, and ages. Only two of us had full seizure-control - myself, and another patient whom I'll call Marie - and each of us had two different brain surgeries a piece. Marie had initially had a vagus nerve stimulator installed, which entails inserting a silver dollar-sized pacemaker-like device into the upper chest that a neurosurgeon winds around the vagus nerve in the neck. When Marie's seizures recurred, she resorted to a full-fledged craniotomy, which was successful. I first had an elective right temporal lobectomy in April 2014. I was seizure free for two months, until my brain imploded due to a subdural hematoma that had developed subsequent to the surgery. A subdural hematoma is like a giant bruise on the thick membrane under the skull, surrounding the brain. I'm still not sure why the hematoma developed. The neurosurgeon said it may have been caused when a vein in my brain got stretched during the temporal lobectomy. But it may have been brought on when I accidentally banged my head against the freezer door, while retrieving the ice cube tray. The emergency craniotomy was harrowing, and brought on a series of grand mal seizures - four in a week. Full recovery took over a year, as I had to take inordinate amounts of anticonvulsants, to control seizure activity. The medications made me lethargic, but over time I was able to titrate them down to something tolerable. Eventually I was both functional and seizure-free. My neurologist calls my story a success, which feels like a misnomer. While it's true my seizures were ultimately brought under control, it seems misleading to call a procedure \"successful\" when it results in a grueling near-death experience. Yet as I listened to the others' stories - those who had only had one brain surgery, and still had refractory seizures - I felt lucky. One patient also had severe memory loss resulting from the surgery. The other spoke of the disappointment that came with having his driver's license revoked after the seizures returned. Their journeys are confirmation of surgery's poignant fallibility. Brain surgery has a 70% success rate as a treatment option for refractory epilepsy, a percentage most teachers would call C minus. When you get a mediocre grade at school, there's typically wiggle room to make it up - an extra credit assignment, or retake exam, perhaps. When brain surgery doesn't work, the only possible option for a grade boost is a second surgery. At best this is a huge undertaking, beset with a multitude of invasive extensive pretests. Yet that is what the neurologist is likely to suggest to a post-surgery epilepsy patient who still has refractory seizures. When the panelists asked for feedback I piped up, \"I think it's surprising that everybody in the room has already had surgery. I expected there would be patients here with questions about surgery, but we're all old hands at this.\" \"My patients think if they attend something like this, they're committing to having surgery, and they're not ready yet,\" an MGH neurologist responded. \"What advice would you give to a patient considering surgery?\" she asked the group. \"I'd tell them that if they're brave enough to live with uncontrollable seizures, they definitely have enough chutzpah to undergo surgery,\" I offered. \"I'd tell them it's a scary, taxing procedure, and no matter how good your doctors are, there's a lot they don't know. Also there's no guarantee of success.\" I looked at the others around the room - we were living proof. Perhaps the doctor would pass my insights on to her anxious patients. One thing I knew for sure: a doctor cannot convey the huge disappointment a patient feels if s/he goes through this procedure, and still has seizures. For the patient choosing brain surgery to treat uncontrollable seizures, there's a 30% chance of that outcome, making it a significant gamble. They should make that wager only after they're fully informed about the mediocre success rate, and the ample risks involved, as they are taking an enormous leap of faith. Hopefully, they will make the grade. Laura Beretsky is a writer who lives in Somerville, Massachusetts with her husband, children, and cat.

    "data": "Spring 1997 I eye up the worn and tattered catcher's mitt 20 feet ahead. It's a warm May morning and the elementary school bus is coming down the street in 10 minutes. But, more importantly, baseball season is finally here. Mom is down in the catcher's stance, \"Fire it in here!\" she shouts and then grins at me as I start my wind up. I pull my gloved hand up to my face and tuck my right hand in, resting the ball in the heel of the glove. I take a short step to my right and shift my weight slightly over my right foot. I swing my left leg up high and, pushing off my right leg, send everything I've got into the pitch, whipping the ball at mom, as she squats in the grass with the mitt held open wide. The ball smacks into the glove's weathered pocket with a \"Crack!\" \"Isn't that the best sound, And!?\" she exclaims, firing the ball back to me and readying herself again. We have to get 10 pitches in before the bus comes. There is no secret to being good at something. You just have to love to practice. That is her philosophy. Now it is mine too. January 2011 It's now junior year of college and my morning routine has shifted away from baseball. Now I get up, eat oatmeal, and review notes before class. Fewer \"heaters\", a lot more books, but the same philosophy: love to practice, love to learn. I write frequently in the journal I keep on my computer. So far it is mostly ramblings -- on my dying faith in the Catholic church (what's the point of God?), on my breakup with my high school girlfriend (what's the point of love?), on my fascination with cell biology and chemistry (what's the point of studying anything else but the pure molecular basics of life itself!?) In this moment, my relationship with cancer is so ordered and neat and sterile. It is a series of PowerPoint presentations in air-conditioned classrooms. A set of logical experiments, producing clear data from which succinct conclusions are drawn. It is graphs and figures and tables and genes and proteins and signaling pathways. I have a poster outlining all the known cellular pathways that contribute to cancer on the wall beside my bed. Cancer biology is what I do, not something I fear. April 2011 That ordered, neat, sterile, intellectual relationship with cancer collided with the powerful, unpredictable, emotional, force of real life on a beautiful spring morning later that semester. I am home for the weekend from school, with my mom. Our morning ritual is to have a cup of Irish breakfast tea together. Always with a splash of evaporated milk and a half teaspoon of honey. We started this in high school when she was teaching 9th grade and I would hop a ride to school with her each morning. I made my cup and walked out to the back porch where she was sitting, her mug beside her, at our small wrought iron table. If that table could talk, it could tell the entire history of our family. It has sat on the cracked slab of concrete we call the back porch ever since we moved in on Evelina Road \"Good morning, Andrew\" my mom says as she smiles and looks up at me from the crossword puzzle, looking not quite her usual chipper, enthusiastic self. I don't remember exactly what we talked about at first, but, eventually, she said to me, \"I've got some news, And. I went to get this thing on my leg checked out and they said I've got some bad cells.\" To me, immersed in a Cancer Biology class, bad cells equal cancer. No need for further description. I just took an exam on this very topic. How ironic is that? \"Bad cells\" stop doing their jobs. \"Bad cells\" disobey orders. \"Bad cells\" exhibit the 6 characteristics of cancer, which I can hardly remember in this moment. \"What did the path report say?\" I ask. \"What kind of cells? How fast are they replicating? What stage is it?\" In this moment of internal turmoil, I grasp for what is familiar to me - the science and the cells -- rather than looking for what might be helpful for my mom. She recognizes my angst and -- despite the fact that she received the diagnosis, she will receive the treatment, she will be confronted with her own mortality in the coming weeks-- she opens her heart and comforts me. June 2011 You would never find mom inside on a sunny day. She'd be ticking off miles walking all over town with her best friend, hitting the tennis ball with a fellow teacher, or kneeling in the garden behind the house, back bent, hands covered in mud, transplanting some black-eyed Susan's or pulling weeds. But on this \"glorious summer day\", as she would most certainly have proclaimed it, there she was, inside. She was curled up with blankets in her bed, her hair, frizzled and wild, pushing out over the covers. She was now a few weeks into interferon treatment for her cancer. On the days of her infusions, she collapses into bed with chills and whole body aches. It's jarring seeing my mom so visibly weak. She could not help the shivering. She could not bite her lip and just power through the aches. The interferon was pummeling her and I hated the medicine for doing that, even though I knew, theoretically, that it was helping. I went into the room and wrapped my arms around her without anything to say. Eventually she completed the treatment and the chills and the aches stopped. The scans came back \"clean\"; but that might have been the easy part: getting cancer off the scans. The real hard part is getting it off your mind. Mom told me that the greatest challenge after treatment is not becoming obsessed that every headache or cold, sharp pain or little rash is a sign that the cancer is back. For the rest of us, at least superficially, things seemed to be \"normal\" again. We didn't really talk about cancer. We didn't use the term \"remission\". We just assumed \"cured.\" It was logical. Plain and simple. Mom had cancer. Mom endured the treatment. Mom beat it. Like we knew she would. We could all move ahead with our lives now, thank you very much. April 2015 Until last spring, April 2015. She went in for her yearly PET scan. She came back with \"findings\" that needed to be explored with a biopsy. \"This really is not happening,\" I remember thinking to myself, \"Why not?\" came an internal reply. The worst was confirmed: metastatic melanoma, stage IV cancer (\"That's the last stage,\" I remember telling my older brother when he asked me how many stages there are). September 2015 Now I'm in the first year of medical school. Tomorrow we will be talking about melanoma in class. I am doing the reading to prepare and I come across the survival statistics. Odd that I have never actually looked this up myself before. The five-year survival rate for a person with stage IV lung metastases is 17%. I stare at the accompanying figure, a Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Looking out at the 16-month marker on the x-axis: not many survivors. Were all those dots on the chart really someone's mom or dad, or brother or sister? I keep reading, \"Malignant melanoma is the cutaneous neoplasia with the greatest mortality rates and one of the malignancies with the highest potential of dissemination. The prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma is grim...\" Time for a shower, I think,. Enough studying for tonight. I walk down the hall of our dorm in my sandals, head straight to the showers and turn the water on hot. I get in and stand there for a few moments, letting the water pour over me. \"The prognosis is grim,\" I think to myself, \"17% survival at 5 years.\" \"Shit,\" I whisper. I am hit with this longing to see my parents and be with my brothers. I picture my mom's funeral. My brothers carrying the casket. I picture my dad speaking at the wake, thanking everyone for coming. There's my mom's sister and brother. There's her best friend. There are her nephews waving goodbye to her. I picture my mom on the back porch with a cup of tea, looking toward the sun. The hot water runs over me and I weep. I cover my face, but what is the point? I can't stop it; the tears flow, falling off my face, joining the water droplets from the shower, crashing into the tile and falling down the drain. I want to follow them down there. September 2016 I pull a mask over my face, slip a pair of gloves on while I make my way over to the metal table to join my classmates, who are peering over specimens while a pathology resident asks a question: \"What do you guys think this person died of?\" I pick up the cold tissue in my hands. Definitely a lung, though it is collapsed now, greyish-tan color - bland, lifeless. The tissue is dotted by small dark specks, some as small as a pencil's tip, others the size of its eraser. I roll these little specks through my fingers. They are smooth, but irregularly shaped. They are hard and stick well to the tissue. They are uniformly black. \"Is that from smoking?\" a classmate ventures. \"No, but good guess!\" the resident replies excitedly, \"That black stuff isn't from particulate matter. Think about what cells can make that sort of pigment.\" Another student speaks up, \"Skin cells. Melanocytes produce pigment!\" The resident, who nods in approval, concludes, \"Yes, this patient died from metastatic melanoma.\" The group shuffles to the adjacent table where diseased kidneys await us. I stand with the melanoma lung in my hands and roll my fingers over the small bumps again and again. As a medical student, I've learned enough to fear diseases like cancer, by studying their pathology, watching tumors excised from abdomens in the operating room, or as I did recently, holding the nodules of metastatic melanoma in my hands. But as a son, the disease is not so much what I'm afraid of...loss is. The cellular morphology isn't scary. Even the scans aren't that scary. The thought of being without someone irreplaceable, like my mom, is what is terrifying. Sometimes I try to live only as the medical student, sometimes only as a son. This experience, I'm learning requires both, and, as a great poet has said, the only way forward it seems, is to live like the river flows, carried by the surprise of its own unfolding.* * John O'Donohue Read more from Medical Student Voices here Learn more about the Community Voices and discover more empowering health stories here Andrew is a second year medical student at Harvard Medical School.",

    "data": "The day I learned that I needed hip surgery, I cried tears of relief. On September 23, 2013, I was playing in a JV field hockey game when all of a sudden, after passing the ball to a teammate, I felt something go wrong. It was... a pop?... a snap?... a tear?... and it came from somewhere in my left backside. I could not identify precisely where--in my lower back, upper hip, or glute--I felt it. As I crawled off the field, I struggled to assemble an explanation to provide the athletic trainer. To this day, I cannot say exactly where it was or what it felt like, but I do know, as the past three and a half years have proven, that something was not right. For the first eleven months after my injury I was diagnosed with a torn muscle in my hip, but physical therapy did little to relieve my pain. I began to see an orthopedic surgeon specializing in hips, who saw nothing notable on my MRIs and encouraged me to continue treating with physical therapy. After months and months of hard work without relief from the pain, I started to worry that I was somehow doing it wrong. Finally, a new MRI of my hip, this time done with contrast dye, showed torn cartilage in the joint. This would require surgery to repair. When, after a year of persistent and unidentifiable pain, as well as numerous consultations with hip specialists, a surgeon walked into my examination room and claimed that he knew exactly how to cure my pain, I sat on the table in front of him and sobbed. The recovery would be long and painful, but at least it would mean I was healing. At this point I would have done anything. After my surgery, I completed nine months of physical therapy to rehabilitate my hip and the rest of my body. But as the physical therapy came to an end, I noticed that something still felt off. I occasionally had that same original pain; it was a pain distinctly different from the normal soreness of post-operative recovery, and I was all too familiar with how it felt. Worried that the operation had failed, I tried to ignore my discomfort for a year and a half. I was terrified that if the surgery had not provided a cure, then nothing could. This past December, after the pain suddenly grew much worse, I finally decided that I could no longer ignore my fears. I scheduled a follow-up appointment with my hip surgeon, who referred me to a spine center to look for other possible causes for my pain. To this day, my doctors and I are still searching for its source. My pain taunts me. It comes and goes. It moves from place to place. It floats, it hovers, over my mind and body, cruelly defying articulation. The English language offers a myriad of terms to describe pain: sharp, dull, burning, throbbing, sore, stiff, tender... the list goes on. And yet, my three-and-a-half-year search for the words to most accurately capture my experience has left me with the following clumsy explanation: most of the time it does not feel quite like a throb, but more like a series of discrete pinching and tugging sensations with each movement of my lower body, located somewhere between my sacroiliac joint and L5 disc; other times--when I sit or stand for too long--it aches across most of my lower back. Sometimes, though, the pain deviates from both of these descriptions. Without looking at a calendar or an MRI report, I can list off the top of my head everything I have done in the past three and a half years to try to relieve this pain--five MRIs, a CT scan, countless X-rays, six specialists, two chiropractors, two injections, and one unsuccessful surgery--including the dates on which most of them took place. But, despite my three and a half years of familiarity with this injury, I cannot explain how it physically feels. Three years ago, I spent my time training for the sport I loved, pushing through the pain of conditioning and doing everything I could to prevent the pain of injury. Now, I spend my time catering to physical pain, altering my movements and avoiding certain motions altogether. I prepare for each doctor's appointment by obsessively practicing my story--the words I've carefully picked to best convey how the pain feels--in my head. I brace myself for the disappointment of watching yet another medical professional fumble for a diagnosis. And I desperately hope for the opposite: I hope that one of these appointments will lead to definitive answers. I hope to one day again cry tears of relief like those I cried the day I believed in the miraculous powers of hip surgery.

    "data": "Jennifer Sax Director of Communications, Good Shepherd Community Care By Val Walker 1. What sparked your interest in having conversations about our end-of-life care? When I was 14, I began volunteering for a hospice in Maine where my mother worked as a nurse--and she still is a hospice nurse. Even as a teen, and throughout my life-- both personally and professionally, I have witnessed how having conversations about one's end-of-life wishes has impact on the way we live our lives. These conversations are not just about dying. They are about how we want to live until we die. They are about taking responsibility, expressing our values and advocating for our care. 2. What are the most important reasons for having conversations with our loved ones and providers about the end of our lives? Studies consistently report that one of the single most important factors in whether patients and family members report a positive end-of-life experience is whether or not they have had a conversation with their family and loved ones about their wishes. We find that when people have had these conversations, caregivers and loved ones suffer less complicated grief - and have less guilt, confusion and stress. As providers, by initiating \"the conversation\" we have the opportunity to significantly and effectively change the kind of care people receive. I'm a firm advocate for having these conversations from an early age. Life can be unpredictable and it's never too late, until it is. The earlier and more frequently we can be having these conversations the more comfortable we will become and the less likely we are to end up making decisions in crisis. 3. As a communications professional, how do you currently advocate for having end-of-life conversations? As part of my role in directing the programming of Good Shepherd Institute, I frequently have the opportunity to raise awareness and promote community dialogue around end-of-life issues and planning. I believe that we are in the midst of a pseudo \"social revolution\" towards increasing people's comfort with end-of-life issues ---advance care planning is an integral piece. There are lots of wonderful organizations out there doing this work. I recently participated in a new media campaign for The Conversation Project and we have had the pleasure of hosting its founder, Ellen Goodman, at one of our Institute Dinners. Good Shepherd is also a partner of Honoring Choices Massachusetts and we participate annually in National Healthcare Decisions Day (April 16th) by sponsoring community programming and education. This year we are hosting \"Who's Your Proxy\" as a fun and interactive way to take some of the \"edge\" and stigma away from these topics. 4. Because you're so active in teaching the importance of end-of-life conversations, how do you envision the healing role of conversation in general for health care? With the influx of the electronic medical record and changing health care regulations, I believe we have been at risk of discouraging conversations between patients and providers. That said, there are advocates for change out there (Dr. Atul Gawande, Being Mortal) and certainly some Medicare reform that speaks to the importance of these conversations. The bottom line is that I think people need to be advocates for themselves and know that they can \"open the door\" to these conversations - not only with family and loved ones, but with providers as well. For so long we have been a society focused on cure. Having these conversations is about shifting our focus to what is truly important. I couldn't agree more, Jennifer. Thanks so much for speaking with me today!

    "data": "The end of the story is this: it is over. It worked. I am grateful. So why do I feel so traumatized? I grew up thinking that breast cancer was my destiny. Inevitable. A foregone conclusion. My mom had it and so did her mom and so did her aunt. I was doomed. So when I was diagnosed with cancer this summer, I was, well - shocked. Because I had lymphoma, not breast cancer. And it was the best kind of lymphoma ever - the slow growing variety that my doctor said would not kill me. Call it cancer lite. Still, it was recommended that I get 6 treatments of a combined chemo (Bendamustine) and monoclonal antibody (Rituxan) to target the nasty B cells that were taking over my abdomen. Reluctantly, I signed up. The treatment was said to bewell toleratedand I would not lose my hair. I'd probably gain weight because of the steroids. I could still eat fruit (wait - why wouldn't I be able to eat fruit?) as long as I washed it for one minute. Think about that. A minute is a looong time to wash a nectarine. I could also go to the dentist for a cleaning, as long as it was right before a treatment cycle began. I would be more sensitive to the sun (how is it possible to bemoresensitive than I already am?) and could not take ibuprofen or aspirin because of concerns around bleeding. Hmm...Tylenol has never touched any pain I've had. And I had to call if I got a fever of 100.4 or higher. I would be immune-suppressed and vulnerable to illness. This was starting to get scary. Each treatment was two days. Treatments were 28 days apart.Like having your period, momsaid my daughter. Day one was almost a full day and day two was about half a day. I would sit in a Barcalounger and could bring one other person with me. That first treatment was, well, awful. I had to start a drug to prevent tumor lysis syndrome (lisoprinol) and steroids (decadron) a few days before. In addition to the steroids and lisoprinol and the two treatment drugs, I got Tylenol, Benadryl, IV Pepcid, and two long-acting anti nausea medications. Both days. When did medicine switch fromtreatingsymptoms topreventingthem? The treatments were Thursday and Friday. That weekend, I felt drugged and out of it. My brain didn't work, my body felt inhuman. I smelled like a Superfund site and I felt like a drug addict. The anti-nausea medications constipated me. For days. The steroids made me feel like, well, I was on steroids. I walked several times a day with an aggressive energy. My house was never so clean. And when, as directed, I stopped taking the steroids, I could not get out of bed. I was completely flattened. I slowly climbed out of that first hole. I felt anxious and eyed food with suspicion. Favorite foods made me queasy - coffee, anything dairy, carbs, sweets. Kind of like being pregnant again. I lost 20 pounds that first month. I lived on well-washed fruit. I crashed at 9 pm every night. I saw germs everywhere and washed my hands compulsively, avoiding hugs, handshakes, and the cat litter box. Before I was to begin my second treatment, I was told I had to have a central line - basically access into a big vein because the chemo was an irritant when given through a small vein. I was told it was for thecomfort of the nurseand that I couldn't receive treatment without it. Really? I had read about portacaths and had told my doctor I didn't want one. So for my first treatment, I was given the IV in the teeny tiny veins in the back of my hand. Sure enough I got some phlebitis (inflammation of the vein with swelling and pain). I almost bailed at this point. I was working with two oncologists at two different hospitals and one of them told me that her hospital did not require a central line for this drug and that the nurses could evaluate my arm veins (which are huge) if I wanted. But that would mean driving 30+ minutes to each treatment, back and forth. Proximity won. I stayed with the hospital that was a 10 minute drive from my home. And I had to make my choice. My choice for central access was either a PICC or portacath. Look them up.Everyone likes their port.Most people end up with a port,I was told.I knew 2 women who had ports. Neither liked it much. One had a massive infection on her chest which required the port's removal. The other said that it never stopped hurting. Neither the PICC nor port sounded good to me. I felt like I was starving and being told I could have dog food or cat food. I had scheduled the portacath surgery and done the necessary pre-screening and special germ-killing washing beforehand. But after talking to the radiologist on the morning of, I decided on the PICC for one reason: he told me that PICCs are used for short term treatments and are good for only 6 weeks. That sounded heavenly: I could have one in for 2 treatments and then get a month break before having a second one inserted. I would need 3 in all. The idea of having surgery to get a port installed and have the nurse insert the IV into my chest at treatment was repulsive to me. When I showed up for treatment with my newly-installed PICC (which I already hated), my nurse asked me why I didn't get a port.Everyone likes their port.When I told her I could have the PICC taken out after six weeks, she said that most people keep theirs in for the entire six months. She even doubted what I told her and called down to radiology to ask if they had told me that six week thing. Hmm. Maybe the radiologist told me the six week rule to encourage me to get the port.Everyone likes their port.Well, not me. Here's what I didn't like about the PICC: it was external so I had this very obvious looking medical device sticking out of my arm. I wore a fishnet stretchy covering over it so that it wouldn't get caught on things. I had to wrap it in Gladwrap Press'n Seal before I showered and my husband (a physician) had to change the dressing every week. Here's what I liked about my PICC: I only had to have it in for six weeks at a time. Did I mention that? For the second treatment, my steroids were tapered so that I wouldn't get flattened. Well, that worked, but I began to lobby fornosteroids. And fewer anti-nausea medications. For my third treatment, I had no steroids and only one anti-nausea medication. Still, I felt over-drugged for symptoms I wasn't experiencing. I never showed signs of infusion reaction nor did I have severe nausea. For my fourth treatment, I was given Zofran for nausea instead of the other two drugs. Yet, I was still not given a choice. I got it in my IV. I wantednoanti-nausea medication. I found that I recovered more quickly and felt overall better with fewer drugs in my system. For my fifth treatment I was given 2 Zofran pills. I took one. No IV anti-nausea meds. Still, each treatment left me feeling crummy for about a week and a half. The chemo began to show toxic signs in my body: my blood counts were low and I got a mouth sore. My fifth treatment had to be delayed a few days so my counts could recover. I was encouraged to get a shot of Neulasta to boost my neutrophils, but warned about the bone pain it could cause. I settled instead on one shot of Neupogen, about 1/20th the strength of Neulasta. The shot worked and my counts were fine when I went back four days later. Out came that awful PICC at the end of day two. That treatment turned out to be my last. I opted not to have the sixth treatment because I was in remission after number three and the chemo was starting to have some toxicity. And I didn't want to have that awful PICC put back in for that last treatment. Looking back I am grateful that the treatment worked and that I no longer have tumors. But I wonder if the process could have been more patient friendly. Instead of giving every patient drugs to prevent every possible side effect, why not give a choice? Had someone asked me if I wanted drugs topreventnausea or drugs totreatnausea if I got it, I probably would have chosen the latter. The treatment was not associated with a lot of nausea and I do not easily get nauseous. And why have a blanket policy around central line access? Not every hospital does. I felt bullied and cornered into doing something I did not want to do. Perhaps a larger arm vein or a slower infusion would have been enough to prevent phlebitis. But we'll never know. The experience made me realize that once you sign on for a medical treatment, you step onto an escalator - and, like an escalator it's really hard to get off. Every intervention brings with it a protocol and sometimes a side effect. You go into it thinking OK, I'll get this treatment - I will permit these chemicals to be infused into me - because I'm told it will make my cancer go away. You then learn that in order to get this treatment, you have to submit to countless other chemicals, interventions, and scans. It's like Get Smart - you walk into a door and there's always another door you need to go through. And another. Youneverfeel in control of your body. You never feel like you have arealchoice. Feeling out of control is a huge component of being a patient and for me, it is this element more than any other that causes the trauma that I feel even now, over eight months after the end of my treatment. Allowing patients to participate in decision making around their care - giving them real choices - even if it means more work for the caregiver, can only be a plus.

    "data": "The unit is separated from the outside world by two pairs of locked double doors. A blinking green light and a soft beep herald our passage through them into a no-man's-land where a guard sits, patiently unlocking the doors as we come and go. When I enter the airlock the first morning, hang my coat and stow my backpack, it feels as though I'm in a sci-fi movie, an intergalactic explorer awaiting my first excursion into the uncharted expanses of space. The atmospheres equilibrate and, I will soon learn, norms are stripped away, decompressed. Not sure what to expect, the door chirps open and I step into my month-long rotation on the inpatient psych ward. Each morning, residents, psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, and I pile into a tiny, windowless room with chairs pushed up against the walls in two rows facing each other. I am the only medical student among them, a wide-eyed interloper squeezing into a center chair. Patients are led in one by one to sit beneath a watercolor painting of goldfish in a pond while we ask them things like, \"How is your mood today?\" and \"Did you need your Zyprexa to sleep last night?\" A pleasantly psychotic woman, untroubled by her delusions of being a powerful real estate lawyer - she is homeless but insists that her office has faxed her discharge paperwork - doesn't seem to notice that I'm there. With fifteen or twenty minutes per patient and our elbows and knees bumping up against each other, these encounters are concentrated in time, in space, in feeling, and they leave me jelly-legged and dazed when I finally stand up hours later. Every minute I'm cycling through the full range of human emotion, from proud to sad to irate to hopeful. I fidget in my chair as tremulous patients beg for benzos. I hold back tears as a suicidal businessman crumples wet tissues in his bandaged hands. Sometimes I just stare at the goldfish and wonder if this is what it's like to be crazy. One day a few months prior on a surgery rotation, I stood in the OR at the end of a long case, carefully running a subcuticlar skin closure. \"You're a natural.\" The surgeon, arms crossed, looks over my shoulder. \"What specialty do you want to go into?\" \"Neurology.\" I watched the last stich pull the skin into a taught pink line the patient would remember me by. \"Neurology?\" She sounded confused. \"But don't you want to fix people?\" Her jaw was tight and face serious. This was nothing new. From the beginning of medical school we are taught to diagnose and treat. We recite mnemonics for the acute management of myocardial infarctions, and can name first, second, and third line therapies for asthma. We titrate blood pressures to evidence-based levels, and feel weirdly satisfied when our heart failure patients pee after a dose of diuretics. We are taught to grow from the first year student who can report that something is wrong to the doctor who can do something about it. On the psych ward, my patients' foggy insights clouds my own. I find myself in the thick of the confusion with them, trying desperately to \"fix,\" to \"cure,\" to achieve some venerated end I had been conditioned to strive for, and driving myself insane with an inexplicable rage when I can't. A woman with a functional tic can't accept that her problem is not the result of medical errors and refuses psychiatric intervention. A kind man with bipolar disorder and an addiction who got high and tried to crash his yacht tinkers with his medication doses and stares silently out the window at the sailboats dotting the river below. A deeply depressed attorney can't allow himself to just feel sad. Seeing them every day is excruciating: each carefully articulated question I ask falls flat, and simple conversations quickly turn into circular back-and-forth's that devolve to the absurd. Every day I feel like banging my head against the wall, and each night I drag home the weight that others can't carry. Shelly* is 30-something, wiry, all clavicle and bony knees- breakable, almost - with thick glasses that magnify her round eyes and give her a permanently forlorn look. She wears Victoria's Secret sweatpants with a black sweatshirt and Ugg boots, her long brown hair pulled into two braids that fall down her back. The night before her arrival, she had lined up her anxiety pills, her mutinous artillery of serotonin and GABA, in one last attempt to create order in her chaotic life, before swallowing them one by one. However, her final act of treason was interrupted, and she ended up with us. When we first meet, she is reticent, eyes downcast, giving up only a word or two in barely a whisper. But soon, she opens up. Two young women in a foreign land, we hit it off: she shows me the drawings she makes in the journal she guards tightly against her chest with crossed arms as she walks around the unit, and talks about seeing her dog when she gets home. She is tougher than her small frame lets on, both physically and mentally. After a week of dutiful CBT practice, she is deemed ready to go conquer her automatic negative thoughts on her own, out in the real world. On the last day of my rotation the two of us sit under the goldfish, talking about going home, about passing through the airlocked doors back to the outside world. Suddenly, her face clouds and she begins to cry for the first time since she's been here. I hand her tissues. \"What's wrong?\" I break the silence. \"I feel like a failure,\" she says through tears. \"I've worked so hard, what if I'm not actually better? What if I go home and it all starts again?\" I pause. \"Well, at least you're trying, right? That's pretty good.\" I watch her think about this for a moment, brow furrowed, tiny fists balled in her lap. \"Yeah,\" she smiles a little to herself, eyes looking thoughtfully at the floor. \"I guess that's something.\" Back between the doors, I wait for the green light one last time. Four weeks, ten discharged patients, dozens of prescriptions, and countless long silences later, I don't think I fixed anyone. I sat with them, though, through all the tears and all the tic-ing, and heard what they had to say. Maybe this is how we help: we shelter, we stabilize, we listen, and we together we take steps, however small. We may not always be able to fix. We may not know what happens when our patients leave the quiet of the pond for the rough ocean waves. But we try. Well, I reassure myself, I guess that's something. * Name has been changed Emma Meyers is a third year medical student at Harvard Medical School.

    "data": "There are days when dealing with this chronic illness just becomes too much and I simply want to curl up in a corner and wait for it to end. I'm tired of all the doctor appointments, being sent from specialist to specialist, trying to explain over and over again the many symptoms I've been experiencing every day for the last 5 years. I'm tired of pain, of weakness, exhaustion, difficulty breathing, night sweats, lack of sleep, trouble swallowing, muscle spasms, twitches and involuntary kicks and flinches, and all the other symptoms that have joined the party. I'm tired of trying medication after medication, hoping to find one with minimal side effects or allergic reactions. I'm tired of dealing with the insurance company and explaining to doctors why I can't work. I'm tired of feeling like I need to convince everyone that there is something very physically wrong in my body when to the outside world I look normal. I'm tired of doctors giving one diagnosis, then another, doing their best but not able to provide any words of comfort. First, they say I likely have ALS, then Amyloidosis, then Isaac's Syndrome, then some other horrible incurable disease but no one can be sure yet, so I'm told to wait to see how it progresses. I've waited and I've waited, it's been 5 years, can someone just tell me what the heck is going on? I'm tired and weary. These are the thoughts that rise to the surface of my mind from time to time, and I'm starting to feel more comfortable with that now. I'm learning to give myself space and permission to feel what I feel when I feel it. For me, this means... Allowing myself to feel sad on days when it's really windy and I long to be windsurfing Acknowledging that I really miss having a healthy body that's able to participate in all of the sports I love Having the courage to say no when asked to join friends for an evening out, trusting that they will ask again and not give up on me because of my illness Making peace with the reality of a life that is largely lived indoors, and being much less active than I would like Admitting the feelings of guilt I have about not being able to work and not advancing in my career Accepting the feeling, whether real or created in my own mind, that I'm being judged for not trying hard enough Allowing myself to feel angry and frustrated because there is no end to this illness \"treadmill\", and there is nothing I can do to change it. I don't have to save myself from these uncomfortable emotions by plastering on a brave, happy face when I feel like crap because let's face it, being chronically ill sucks. I don't stay in this headspace all the time because I don't feel this way all the time, but I do let these thoughts and feelings have their way with me when needed, knowing that I can always find my way back to a place of happiness and contentment. Discovering the Buddhist art of being present to life just as it is, completely free from judgment, has been paramount in helping me learn to stay open to all of the thoughts and feelings that arise through chronic illness. The practice of remaining open-hearted toward all of my experiences has reduced my resistance to the various difficulties I face and has given me the ability to unconditionally accept the circumstances of my life. Viewing my challenges with kindness and treating myself with compassion empowers me to make good choices for myself and helps me think creatively about the life I want to live. Self-compassion has stretched me into learning how to accept help and kind words from friends where earlier I would have tried to go it alone because I didn't want to show weakness or be a burden to anyone. I've also learned that when I'm having a pretty rough time physically it's okay for me to say, \"I don't have to have a 'productive day' today; today I'm watching Netflix because that's the very best and kindest thing I can do for myself.\" This willingness to kindly do what my body requires by accepting help or resting for weeks on end is no longer something that makes me feel less-than or weak; it provides what I need for living a full life. I've become truly happy again and am loving life and all the possibilities it holds, despite my illness and its restrictions. Self-compassion has given me what I need to look at my life and situation in a way that says, 'My illness isn't who I am; I'm someone who still has a lot to offer to the world'. I've become excited about my life and what may be on the horizon instead of being fearful of what might happen. My illness has benefited me by giving me the time for some much-needed self-reflection, which has led to a greater insight into who I really am, how much I'm loved, what I love, and the many ways I can still add value to the world. It feels a little like I've been given the gift of a new life. While I can no longer do many of the activities I love to do, like windsurfing, tennis, golf (just about any sport really), I have begun to discover that I am much more than the sports I played or the career I had. I have a wide variety of loves in my life that previously I either ignored or just hadn't noticed. But because my health has thankfully required me to slow down, I am discovering them now. I am so much more mindful of the beauty, life, and love I see all around me every day. I enjoy it in the deep and meaningful conversations and experiences I have with my wife, I experience it in the wonder of nature and the myriad shades of green that bloom at the beginning of spring, I see it in the care-free dogs that are affectionately taken for walks beneath my balcony every day, I hear it in the laughter and joy of the children playing at the nearby school, and just as nature and dogs never seem to worry about what's in the future, these kids have yet to discover that worrying and looking ahead is a \"thing\": they are just revelling in each moment. Learning to live this way has not eliminated my illness and symptoms, but it has started to remove the suffering caused by focusing on what is wrong, what I can't do, and what could go wrong. I have slowly found myself realizing that, although I'm not healthy, and physically I sort of feel like I've been hit by a bus every day for the last 5 years (and that bus always seems to back-up to hit me one more time just to be sure I don't walk away without a limp - I hate that dang bus), I'm not suffering anymore. I'm learning to live life defined by what I love, not by my illness. Because of poor health, my career may have stalled and my physical abilities may be limited, but my capacity to be curious, to take a deep inner look at myself, to learn self-compassion instead of self-pity, to try new things that I would have been too fearful to attempt in my old life, to be willing to take chances like I'm doing right now by writing, have flourished. At 51-years-old I've finally realized that my purpose is to keep discovering what I love, doing what I love, sharing that love with others, and showing those closest to me that they are truly and deeply loved. Chronic illness might have the ability to impose boundaries on my life but it will never be able to set any boundaries on the things I love. I find myself no longer waiting for my illness to depart and my life to arrive; I truly have a life I love right now. Within the boundaries set by a mysterious neurological condition, Chad loves spending his available energy enjoying good food, getting lost in different worlds through writing and reading, strolling in the sunshine, watching sports and being an armchair quarterback. He lives on the Canadian Prairies with his wife (who is also managing her own chronic illness--what a fine pair).",

    "data": "Do not ever be convinced that you can do nothing to help, that you do not matter. To those who are struggling, your efforts to understand, your cheerful words, your helpful attitude, and simply your willingness to contribute and be present, make a difference. I am going to share some pretty personal information. Not a big deal to some of you, I am sure, but to me, it is huge. I am not the kind of person who does this - or at least I did not used to be. But things have changed for me. In early February of 2014, I spent a week in the hospital and was eventually diagnosed with gastroparesis (GP). I am guessing most people have never heard of this; I know I had not, prior to being diagnosed. My life changed in ways I could not have imagined - overnight. One day, I was able to eat at buffets, and the next day, I was unable to tolerate all foods and liquids. I was hospitalized with severe pain and vomiting, put through a battery of tests (including one particularly terrible one where they forced a tube down my nose and pumped my stomach). Eventually, I was diagnosed, but was given only a brief explanation of my illness and its treatment and was sent home. For the next few weeks, I was on a liquids-only diet, and was told that I had to gradually work my way up to soft foods and (eventually) solids. Unfortunately, nothing like that has occurred. I am able to eat some soft foods, in tiny amounts, but it is becoming clear to me that I will likely never again be able to eat \"normal\" foods in \"normal\" amounts. At first, I told myself that I would not let this stupid disease define or control me - it simply WOULD NOT be the center of my life. But as time passed, I began to see how foolish this was. Every single day, every second of every day, I think about food. I see it; I smell it; I cook it and feed it to the other members of my household; but I cannot have it myself. I look in the mirror, and I see a skeleton. I try to eat even small amounts of food, and I am in agony. I am weak and fatigued to levels I did not think were possible. Some mornings, I do not think I have enough energy to get out of bed. I can barely concentrate and function enough to do everyday tasks. And almost every single night, my husband has to help me up the stairs to bed because he is afraid that if he does not, I might fall. My 11-year-old daughter has seen me vomiting, screaming in pain, lying on the floor crying, and on the verge of passing out. At times, it has frightened her so much that she has asked my husband to get me \"Life-Alert.\" I grieve over the fact that I can no longer travel or get out of the house for much of anything. I grieve over missing family events and not being able to attend my daughter's activities. I grieve over not being able to go out to eat, or on a picnic, or to a concert. I worry that I will not get to see my daughter graduate, or get married, or have children. I am not on the verge of death today (at least, I don't think I am), but when I look in the mirror and think about how tired I am, I realize that people like this do not have long life spans - and it bothers me. I get frustrated because people do not understand how my life is affected by all of this. If you were to see me on the street, you would likely not realize I am sick. I do not look very sick. And because most people are unaware of the effects of GP, they ask me all of the time if I am okay now. I can't seem to convince them that I am never going to be okay again - not in the way they mean it. I am told that I \"just need to eat,\" or that if I would only try yogurt, I would be okay. My own doctor (PCP) accused me of being an anorexic and told my husband to \"watch me.\" Though I know people mean well and are trying their best to help, it still makes me frustrated. I am angry because I am a control freak, and I do not like being a slave to this disease. I do not like having to rely on others for help. I have screamed at, smacked, and pushed my husband away for simply trying to assist me more times than I can count. I have thrown things (including food) across the room in fits of anger. I have intentionally gone without eating - even though I know I should not - just to \"show\" this disease who is in control. Crazy, I know! I am angry because I do everything that I am supposed to do - eat the right things, exercise, and ingest the known medications - and I am still sick. I think about the others who have this disease who are so much worse than I am. There are thousands of posts in my Facebook feed every day from people who have had to go to the ER or back in the hospital for dehydration, pain, or other such conditions. I know so many people now who have feeding tubes or ports for nutrition. I know many who have developed other serious conditions because of the GP. I sometimes look at them and think that this will surely be my future, too, and it scares me. There are times when I am in such agony that I can do nothing but cry - lie on the floor and beg God to just let me die. He does not - and I am so thankful that He ignores those moments. I mostly have a good attitude about my situation and try to make the best of it. I feel blessed that I have been given so many years with the best husband and daughter anyone could imagine. I am truly thankful for each day I get to spend with them. I do not understand why I have to have this disease, but God does, and I trust Him. What I do understand is that it is somehow important to me to let people know what I go through - what all GP sufferers likely go through. I am sharing these personal details in such a public forum because I think it is important for people to see this disease and to understand what it is like. But I think it is equally important to share how much I have been blessed BECAUSE OF this disease and to let others know how much they matter and how much of a difference they can make. I first joined a Facebook support group because I wanted to know what treatments and medications others like me had found helpful - but I hated the idea of support groups. I was there for information only; I just knew I did not need anything like support. Not for me! So foolish! You cannot imagine the blessing these online groups have been. I have learned much, for sure, but I have received so much more than information. I have received more support, understanding, and kindness than I ever could have dreamed. I have made friends that I feel I have known for a lifetime. I tell people all of the time that I hate this disease, but I dearly love all the people I have met because of it. I have received help from family members, friends, and acquaintances beyond measure. My neighbors have cooked meals for my husband and daughter; they have watched my child and my pets; and they have offered to transport me to and from appointments. My family has come to visit me, even though I know it is horribly inconvenient for them - and they have also stayed away when I have asked them to, even though I know they wanted to be here. Honestly, every single person I know has helped me in some way. Some have visited, some have called, some have done chores and tasks, and some have simply cheered me up with their stories. All of this has been more of a blessing than I could have known. Do not ever be convinced that you can do nothing to help, that you do not matter. To those who are struggling, your efforts to understand, your cheerful words, your helpful attitude, and simply your willingness to contribute and be present, make a difference.",

    "data": "We all have a story to offer the world. Through our stories, I believe healing can be found. In high school, I started to really understanding this more. When I was a junior in high school, I began sharing bits and pieces of my story and my perception of the world around me in the form of hip-hop songs. I wrote about my identity as an African-American. I wrote about life growing up in the Bronx, NY. I even wrote about my future plans of one day becoming a doctor. This hobby continued as I transitioned to college and I truly began to realize the power behind music and the sharing of words in general. Words are definitely powerful. Scholar Aaron Corn states, \"Songs are indeed powerful. They have the power to soothe, the power to persuade, the power to provoke, the power to educate and the power to lament.\" I experience this first-hand every time I tune into my music. Last semester, as a junior at Brandeis University, I studied abroad in Durban, South Africa, with a program focused on community health and social policy. As part of the program, I had the opportunity to explore any topic of interest and complete an independent study project. For a long time I had no clue what I wanted to study. Throughout the semester I felt a strong calling, however, to pursue the connection between music and healing. During the semester, I had the chance to live with host families both in urban and rural communities. While living in one of the rural communities, called Sandanezwe, my host-brother, Mduduzi, introduced me and the other students in my program to a project that he created in the community. Mdu was in his early thirties and he walked with a limp. Through conversations with him, I learned that he suffered from Polio as a child. The project he created, the Disability Special Project, seeks to create a safe space for the disabled community within Sandanezwe. It is a project established and solely maintained by the disabled community. I saw how Mdu's experiences growing up in this community shaped his vision for this project. In South African society, and many other parts of the world, many people who are considered disabled face exclusion from society and other forms of discrimination. Although I had no prior experiences working with disabled people, meeting Mdu and hearing his story inspired me to learn more. After much thought, I decided to go back and live in the Sandanezwe community for three weeks to conduct my independent study project. I titled my project \"A Mirror to Society: An autoethnography reflecting perspectives of disability through personal narrative in a rural community in South Africa,\" and through this project I sought to hear the stories of members of the Disability Special Project, with a focus on their self-perceptions. I also interviewed members of the greater Sandanezwe community to learn how they viewed people with disabilities. In the middle of my project, I remember waking up one morning very frustrated. Throughout the process, there were many times when I had to throw my plan away. For example, there were many days when the weather was too cold or rainy, and no garden members would show up to work, which meant I wouldn't be able to speak to anyone. This morning, instead of sitting around in misery, I decided to go for a walk and climb to the top of a mountain. I found a nice spot overlooking the beautiful scenery of Sandanezwe. I looked out to my left and saw an endless array of green mountains weaving off into the distance. I interrupted my gaze to select a song to play on my iPhone.Unlocks. Scrolls. Music. Genres. Scrolls. Instrumental. Scrolls. J. Cole. Scrolls. Love Yourz (instrumental). Click.My ears were then greeted with the soothing sound of piano chords. The instrumental was from a song by J. Cole entitled \"Love Yourz\". While listening, I looked up at the mountain range, and the words\"you can, you can, you can\"rang through my mind. I started to think of the interviews I had done so far, and the responses that I had received, especially those of the garden members.\"I can do things, but they won't let me do it!\"echoed the voice of one member in the garden.\"I'm strong! I am a human being,\"rang another garden member's voice. I pulled out my phone and started to note my thoughts. My thumbs moved swiftly.\"Don't let nobody ever tell you, you can't do,\"I wrote,\"Can't walk, can't shoot, can't love, can't live...\"I was writing to those voices of oppression. I was writing to the oppressor. I was writing to myself. One of the last questions I asked the garden members in my interviews was,\"If you were to write a song to the community to help them to understand you better, what would you say?\"As they answered I took note of the responses.\"I can write that God is the beginning and the end, so all our challenges if you can take our problems and put them in God I think all our challenges will disappear,\"one member replied in his soft-spoken voice.\"I can tell people that I'm proud of myself in a way that whatever I contribute in the project it can also benefit the community,\"another determined member responded. \"I will write a song and say that if they see me as a disabled person they mustn't think that I'm useless because they are so many things that I can do for them. They must respect me and have hope in me because I can do of the things that can help them,\"said another. A group of three said,\"We can introduce the song to teach the community that a disabled person can do anything that a person with no disability can do.\" It wasn't my plan to write a song for my project but sometimes the best plan is to just live in the moment. I realized that this was what I wanted in my project all along. I wanted the greater community to hear the voices of these members of the garden. I wanted the garden members to know that their perspective matters. After another day and a half of reflecting on these responses, listening to the instrumental on repeat, and writing, the song was complete! The song is especially powerful because it was created using the words of the garden members. On my final day in the garden, a celebration took place. The Department of Agriculture and Environmental Affairs from a neighboring town came to meet the garden members and planted onion seeds with them, and I performed the song I created for them. Everyone crowded around me with big smiles as I began, and at the end of my rendition, the garden members all clapped and cheered. New life was deposited into the space. Seeds were planted both literally and figuratively in the garden that day. You can watch the Mirror To Society videohere.",

More than one year into recovery at the time of the interview, 25-year-old Anna is living in Denver, Colorado and pursuing a nursing degree. Anna is admirably candid about the challenges of recovery. Six years into her eating disorder - which involved cycles of purging, binging, over-exercising, and restricting - it became clear that she needed more intensive support than just an outpatient team in order to break the patterns. The four months Anna spent in residential treatment and then a transitional living house in California were transformative, but life back in the real world proved surprisingly difficult. Anna admits her eating disorder still tempts her and occasionally catches her off guard with unexpected triggers. In addition to support from her boyfriend Thomas, her parents, and the recovered therapist she works with, Anna possesses an impressive self-awareness and \"Healthy Self\" mentality that she honed in treatment. She discusses how she challenges cultural misnomers about what \"healthy\" means, and the benefits of life in recovery: deeper intimacy and presence in relationships, a burgeoning sense of spirituality, and growing motivation to heal in order to help others. Though it has been rocky at times, Anna is proud of and committed to her recovery. Listen to more stories in the Eating Disorder Recovery series here.",

    "data": "An Interview with Molly Stewart, Mission Services Director at the Cancer Community Center of South Portland, Maine By Val Walker A Cancer diagnosis and treatment can be an isolating experience for many of us. I wanted to learn from Molly how a support organization like the Cancer Community Center could help us break out of isolation by fostering new friendships and a sense of community. On paper, of course, we could assume a community center was supposed to build connection, but in reality, I knew it was difficult to get people engaged after a life-changing illness such as cancer. What did it take to get people in person to bond again after a long period of being in survival mode and pain? Val: A Cancer diagnosis can be an isolating experience. Molly, what does it take to break through the isolation many of us go through? Molly: Breaking through isolation takes courage. After a cancer diagnosis, your social needs could change. And even though you know you need to take the first step, you might not even be sure what you're looking for. You don't know what to expect. It can take a lot of courage just to walk through our doors at the Cancer Community Center. And before you've walked through our doors, it's taken courage to recognize you're lacking support and want to do something about it. It's not unusual for people to express surprise, disappointment or frustration with responses to their cancer diagnosis. Speaking of the courage to be open and vulnerable, I love the work of the author, Brene Brown (The Gifts of Imperfection, Braving the Wilderness). She writes beautifully about the courage it takes to show up for each other, and \"letting ourselves be seen.\" Stepping into our doors at the Cancer Community Center is a statement that we're brave enough to let ourselves be seen, to be open and vulnerable. We hope that is a healing step--just coming to the Center. Val: It's heartening to hear how welcoming you are for those brave enough to step through your doors. Are most people looking for the same kinds of connections and resources? Molly: It's important to remember that everyone has different needs when it comes to social support. We're each unique in what we want, and our social needs change over time. Some people coming to the Center are looking to expand their social network, and others just want a quiet, private space to talk with one another. Some people are aware that they lack social support and want to engage and make connections in the activities at the Center. Others may have enough support from family and friends, and want to talk with someone who has been there. Val: You offer classes, support groups, an individual buddy program, resources. What do you recommend for people living with cancer who feel fearful or hesitant about venturing into new connections? Molly: I encourage people to take small steps in getting out again. You might ask, \"What am I looking for?\" Pay attention and become more aware of the social aspects in all areas of your life-- your physical, emotional, spiritual, financial, and occupational needs. Who is there in these different areas of your life? By just being aware, assessing and reflecting how people influence us or nourish us (or not), we can choose what is best for us as we resurface from isolation. I've studied social science research, and as humans we are wired to be social. We want to belong and feel accepted. Val: I believe strongly that anyone recovering from isolation, whether from an illness, or a loss, needs a period of social recovery. During our ordeal when we're in survival mode, we may have lost our confidence in how to connect with others. We might even feel despondent about people \"not being there\" for us. What do you have to say about our social recovery after a long, lonely period of feeling disconnected? Molly: If we've been disconnected and isolated for a time, and experienced a major life change, we might need time and support to start connecting with others. We might have rusty social skills, less confidence in making connections, or the lens with which we are making connections has changed and we have to adjust to a new social perspective. What I witness with many of our community members is that they're building social confidence, after a difficult life experience. If your ability to connect socially were a muscle, after a time of change in your life (whether that is an illness, the birth of a child, or retirement) you might need to rebuild your social strength with conditioning, to practice in safe and supporting social situations. Once your social muscles are toned up, you feel more prepared to go out into the world, to your workplaces, families, friendships, and communities, having had safe and supportive social interactions that helped to integrate that experience into yourself. Val: That's a brilliant way of looking at rebuilding our confidence to be social again! Yes, it's social conditioning, social muscling-up. Having the Cancer Community Center as a safe place to muscle-up and practice being socially active is a way to prepare us to get back out into the world. What have you learned from working at the Cancer Community Center as their mission services director? Molly: Val, I've had the experience of interacting with hundreds of people diagnosed with cancer and their loved ones when they come to the Center to find support. We sit down often one-on-one with every new community member. When they first come in, they're often scared and overwhelmed. We share information about the programs at the Center, how we can help and work together to identify what they're most interested in. Many activities at the Center are based on a peer support model which means we create opportunities for people to connect with someone else who has had a similar experience. We offer support and educational groups, complementary therapies, nutrition and movement activities. When someone who is recently diagnosed talks with another person who has been there and knows what it's like to get that diagnosis and try to figure out the path ahead of them, it's like seeing a person in the dark find a flashlight. All of a sudden, there is hope. They understand that others have been down this path, and they're here to help and share what they learned, what worked, and what was hard for them, and that every experience is different. It's reassuring to know you're not alone. Val: Would you mind telling us a personal experience of breaking through an isolating time in your own life? Molly: I have had several times, but the most powerful one was when my son was born. I was in grad school when Leo was born. First, there were not a lot of other pregnant grad students, and I was a new Mom. Talk about a life change--you're sleep-deprived, have a huge responsibility of caring for another human being, and you have never done anything like this before. You feel totally challenged every day, and often I felt like I didn't know how do this. I was fortunate to have Birth Roots, a support organization for young parents in my city. I was attending a class for new parents, and heard how other parents were coping, or not. I received the benefit of learning that everything I was going through was normal--yes, crying that much is normal. It gave me more confidence in my new role as a mother. After the group was over, I went back to school, and continued to identify ways to connect with other families. I knew that to have balance in my new role, I had to keep integrating the role of Mother into my identity. I was never a mother before, and now, five years later, that role keeps shifting. First, I was a new parent, then I was the mother of a toddler, then a preschooler, and now have a son in elementary school. It's always changing, but what I have learned is that I need the social support of other parents because they \"get it.\" They are there, and that connection helps immensely to reduce the anxiety, isolation and confusion of trying to navigate the vast challenges of parenthood. Val: Thanks so much for your story and insights, Molly. It's clear we need support organizations when we feel isolated by a major life change. It makes life so much easier to have people at the ready who understand our predicament, so we can practice being socially engaged in new ways. It's heartening to learn from you how we can foster long-lasting, deep friendships, and a build a solid sense of community. Molly: I enjoyed our time, and thanks so much.

    "data": "I met Denise last spring, in a 6-week Narrative Medicine course I co-taught for social workers. She stands out in my memory of the group in many ways: her outfits were always exquisitely coordinated; her eyes sparkled and often glistened with tears; she easily offered humor, truth, and consolation. She always made comments that illuminated the texts we read together in ways I had not previously considered. Perhaps most striking of all was how profoundly the workshop seemed to impact Denise: \"It was a monumental experience for me, in my life, as a clinician and as a person.\" For 28 years, Denise has been serving victims of trauma in Brooklyn and Queens. Although she considers herself strong emotionally and mentally, she inevitably experiences vicarious trauma through her work. Narrative medicine - a field based in the belief that effective clinicians must know how to receive, interpret, and help craft their clients' stories - offers her a means to work through some of that trauma: \"(It) is a healing measure that I can tap into that will keep me grounded, keep me available, keep me conscious. To never ever find myself in a position of 'Oh, I've heard this, I've seen this before...' No. Each time is my first time withthatperson. And (narrative practice) helps with that.\" As traditional narrative medicine occurs in a classroom, the course consisted of closely reading and discussing a piece of poetry or prose every week. Then each participant, facilitators included, composed a brief response to a prompt related to the reading, and shared our writing aloud with one another. Denise has always used writing to sort out her experiences. But the practice of narrative medicine expanded her appreciation for the power of the written word: \"Reading someone else's writing and trying to make sense of it, how I might interpret it, and then using that to be able to reflect and write about a personal experience I've had - that blew me away.\" Denise models how clinicians can incorporate narrative practice into both their personal and professional life. She finds it helpful to do on her own during a busy day at work: \"Sometimes I'll have to sit in my office and close my door and start writing a thought that I had about an experience I just had with someone, and it's safe. It's in a place where I know I can go back to it. I can ground myself. I can be in a place of objectivity instead of subjectivity.\" Denise also introduces her clients to their own narratives during therapeutic encounters, by asking: \"What was the first thing you thought when this happened to you?\" She observes how an invitation for them to tell their first-hand experience of the trauma \"allows them to push everyone else to the side. Often people don't think about their first thought, their first emotion. And that gets them to a place where they can write a (first-person) narrative.\" She guides them to develop their story, through writing or speaking: \"Some write a paragraph, some only write three sentences. And those three sentences we can talk about for weeks. Some of them choose not to write at all, but instead to record their own voices. And they save those recordings in their phone, and they (listen to it) every so often.\" Some of her younger clients even choose to narrate through rap. Once they begin writing - songs, lyrics, poems, any genre - Denise sees them \"healing and moving forward towards closure. They're experiencing and developing or recognizing skills they had but suppressed or pushed to the side, because they didn't consider it important. But it's that very strength they have in them that draws them to a place of healing.\" There is a sense of ownership, mastery, and pride that they gain from becoming authors of their life experiences. Denise encourages her clients to see themselves as she sees them: individuals who have experienced traumatic events, not victims whose stories can be lumped together in domestic violence tropes. She discourages them from telling their stories as: \"I'm a victim of domestic violence and this is what we victims of domestic violence...\" Denise instead tries to help each client realize, through crafting a unique story, that \"You're an individual. This is whatyouwent through. How did it affectyou:yourthoughts,yourbody,youremotions? I want them to be able to write that out. That narrative is so crucial.\" Denise recognizes, in herself and her clients, the radical changes that narrative practice can cause: \"It keeps you from being stuck and unmoveable, to a place where there is mobility, and there are choices. And those choices can be so powerful that it can get people to move from A to B, but in some cases all the way down to Z (where they) find closure.\" Denise vows to carry onward in her clinical practice and personal life using narrative medicine as an unparalleled resource: \"This story practice...I don't think that there's any medication that people can take that does the particular piece that this work does. On a cognitive level, physical level, emotional level - it's not anything that can be replicated anywhere else.\" Below is a poem Denise wrote in honor of her clients and their experiences. Wounded outside in I felt as though I have sinned Wounded inside out Oh how I wanted to shout But there was no way out Confused by the tormenting of my mind It often told me to flee And escape this life of mine These intrusive thoughts Powerful and fierce Lead me into a world of Self-affliction and fear In the shadow and secret nights You told me I was your Queen Once you called me wife Confused by your touch Why did you love me so much? Your hands strong and mighty Forming a fist that would crush my body So, still I stood, unaware of my own breathe Somewhere in the corner of my mind Wondering when will the night terror end The story is out now and my song is strong No longer will I hide in the corner of my mind No longer confused and afraid of the midnight air It stops here Listen to my story loud and clear I am free of the misery and constant fear No longer vulnerable or invisible I am here I will sing loud and strong for the courts to hear What you have done to me over the years It stops here. The table has turned now Hide in the shadow and behold your fate As you will spend the rest of your years Fearing those who have heard my song Denise has worked in the field of social work for the past 28 years servicing victims of trauma both from secular and sectarian backgrounds. She herself has been exposed to many traumatic events that have made powerful imprints in my personal and professional life. Denise has long used journaling as a therapeutic tool. Since being exposed to narrative medicine, when she reads back her written words, she attains centering, grounding, awareness, and healing from the experience of vicarious trauma that affects caregivers in mental health professions. As a patient, and as a caregiver in the role of a doula supporting women through birth, abortion, and miscarriage, I have experienced the power of stories in healing. I recently graduated from the Narrative Medicine master's program at Columbia University, and will begin at Harvard Divinity School next fall to explore the borderlines between ministry and medicine. I also curate an oral narrative project called \"Inside Stories: Medical Student Experience\", for which I interview medical students about their experiences in medical school with the intention to provide a platform for their own person healing, self-realization and empowerment through the sharing and receiving of personal stories. You can listen to their stories on iTunes podcasts or here:http://in-training.org/inside-stories. Over the coming year, I will be working as an intern for Health Story Collaborative and writing a series of blog posts that profile remarkable individuals committed to honoring and making use of stories in health care.

    "data": "Sometimes it feels as if the path to becoming a practicing physician is a path of deferral. As a premedical student and sophomore in college, I have seen my peers engage in a variety of activities that are required for medical school but are not directly applicable to life as a physician. My colleagues have reviewed physics for the MCAT (Medical College Admissions Test), studied the nuances of organic chemistry, and adopted leadership roles by managing large organizations and events. As a premedical student myself, I am often tempted to think of life as a physician as the final attainment of a routine that matters. Finally, instead of focusing on how to fulfill particular requirements and prepare for a standardized examination, a physician can find treatments for patients and help make scientific breakthroughs. Instead of being attuned to the competitive nature of an application process, a physician is able to reflect on how to best relate to their patients with care and empathy and how to best work with other members of their health care team. However, when I ask physicians for advice or insight, they often describe how the practice of medicine is not as ideal as premedical students might project it to be, and has its challenges just as the premedical experience has challenges. For instance, an emphasis on efficiency makes it difficult for physicians and other health care professionals to adequately spend time listening to their patients. The commercialization of the medical field can also make work difficult, and even disillusioning, for physicians. Understanding these realities provides a new perspective for premedical students: an awareness that the practice of medicine is imperfect. Students should expect to be faced with imperfections, such as timing constraints and a frustrating inability to listen fully to patients, during their later years as a physician. Armed with this knowledge and perspective, premedical students know more about what they can expect, and perhaps even change, in the field of medicine. They can also face the path to medical school with a fresh perspective. Because I have realized that the practice of medicine, like the premedical experience, contains elements that do not directly relate to becoming a better physician, I am less frustrated by the process. Instead, I am more focused on how to make my premedical experience translate into a learning experience that will help me become a more engaged physician. More deeply, health care professionals' efforts to fill in the gaps of modern medical practice inspire me and resonate with my idealistic impulse to contribute to the medical field. I hope to be involved with medicine because I hope to help others restore their health, whether they are struggling physically, emotionally, or spiritually. Although a major component of doing this as a physician is of course providing medicine, I am also interested in less traditional ways that health care providers can facilitate emotional healing. Health Story Collaborative is one such example. By providing a space for patients to share their stories with others, Health Story Collaborative creates a sense of community. Patients who are hesitant or unable to leave their homes to attend a support group can still participate. Moreover, some patients may prefer the opportunity for privacy while bringing up uncomfortable or distressing topics with others. Health Story Collaborative also provides more opportunity than a support group for less spontaneous conversation that can more accurately reflect the nuances of a patient's experience. Patients spend time discussing and crafting their narrative with a physician, and the final written or audio transcript can capture more of their experience than quickly delivered thoughts. Efforts such as Health Story Collaborative provide patients with emotional comfort, and also broaden the practice of medicine. By facilitating such efforts, physicians can do more for their patients and feel less constrained by the medical field's commercialization and haste. They can more deeply understand the patient experience, and become more empathetic and better prepared to provide advice that is relevant to specific challenges that patients face. This inspires me as a premedical student and indicates that the practice of medicine is more meaningful and more involved than I could have expected.",

    "data": "By Ashley Brown Held down. I remember light and I remember terror. My heart races. Stabbing searing pain three times. Three permanent tattoos across my hips. \"To make sure we line you up for radiation correctly every time.\" I stare at the ceiling, following the circle of light that changes colors. Changes colors just like my skin, now thin, brown, and brittle. On the ceiling, there is a circle that is a rainbow. Real rainbows are circles anyways. They burn the cancer from my body, just my skin is in the way. Every Friday, I sit in the car on the drive and then they burn me. Until my skin breaks and until I move through the degrees, end on third-degree burns. I wake up in the night and scream. A resident sees the burns and they change colors too, now a pale white. \"We need to burn all of the cancer. We must continue.\" They give me drugs now to numb me so that they can burn me. I drift away on morphine. They burn me and I burn. I wore my first sports bra when I was six: it held my catheter, the tube stemming from my chest, in place. \"This will prevent it from getting tugged by anything.\" I dream of my sisters playing with me again and suddenly they grab the tube and pull. They pull and I unravel. I unravel, a spool of yarn untethered with each tug as my organs are pulled outside of my body. I still dream it. I am at a sleepover and we want to watch a movie. I am 9 but the movie is rated PG-13. I ask to call my mom to get her permission. My friend laughs at me, but I don't understand. There are rules. Don't scratch your burns. Don't play with your catheter. Rules are important. Knowing rules and following them mean I get rewarded. \"If someone gives you anything but Tylenol, what do you tell them?\" \"I can't have that. It is an NSAID, those are too hard on my kidneys.\" I am very smart, very responsible for following rules. I hide my tears as we begin to watch the movie. I am the new kid in a small school where everyone has known each other since kindergarten. They ask if I am in the wrong classroom. I look too young to be in 5th grade. At my new ice-skating rink, there is the group of big girls and the group of little girls. I am seen as too young, too bad of a skater, to be invited with the rest of the little girls. Besides, to get close to them, I would need to do synchro with them. You are not allowed to wear gloves for synchro and my circulation is too bad. My hands will turn translucent and then blue again. In every group number at our yearly Nutcracker, I am too young for someone to start a conversation with, too introverted to reach out myself. I am content with my own company at least. It does not matter that I actually am older than them. In high school, I get louder though. I beat others to the punchline. \"I know, I look like a child. Maybe when I graduate high school, I will look 14! But hey, that's cancer for you.\" When I first get my driver's license, I drop off my sister at rock climbing and go to pick up Taco Bell for her. At the drive through, the cashier sees me pull up and begins to laugh. \"Are you old enough to be driving without an adult in the passenger seat?\" I ascent wearily. She laughs more and tells her friend to come over here and see the youngest looking 16-year-old that he will ever see. I turn red. For the first five years after treatment, that is when cancer is most likely to recur. My body was a ticking time bomb. Every abnormal pain is the beginning of terror. Does this stomachache mean I have cancer in my stomach? Every year, I get strep throat and the lymph nodes around my throat swell into imaginary tumors. Any moment, my body could betray me, leave me without treatment options. \"We can't give you chemo again. There is a maximum dosage and you already received it.\" I am told the next best thing we can do is find it early though, if it does recur. So, they hold me down again. They do CT scans, MRIs. All donut-shaped tubes, but at least these machines don't burn me. They pronate my legs so that my toes touch and heels sit apart and then they tape me still. My heart pounds, tells me to run so that they can't hurt me again. I focus on what I read about how kidneys work while they scan me. The doctors are always more comfortable when I want to learn more. It is something to talk about, something other than the silence, the small talk. I pass the five-year mark. Then they focus on the long-term effects of the cancer, of the chemo. They check my heart. Social workers ask how I am doing in school. I tell them I want to be a pediatric oncologist, or later a cancer researcher. They tell me what a good thing it is. I see them relax. I am saying the right things, I am telling the good story, the right one, the one they want to hear. Am I healthy? Am I sick? I am healthy enough to the sight that any physical failing must be a moral one. I am healed, but I hurt. My kidneys grew with me during puberty, scarred and disfigured as they are, so I will not need another kidney until I grow old. Regular menstrual cycles, no matter how physically painful, mean that I am fertile, at least for now. But why would I want my own kids anyways? With my biology, I offer a 50% chance of damnation. My heart passes my yearly screening exams though and my liver continues unscathed. \"You are doing so well.\" They tell me that every year I go to my annual Long-Term Cancer Survivor Clinic appointments. How can I disappoint them? The doctors and nurses and social workers did so much to make my treatment manageable. To distract me from the horrors of it. But that is not fair to me. Just because I have good grades, just because I am involved in extracurriculars, just because I have a long-term relationship does not mean that I am healed. It does not mean that my cancer basically never happened, just an unfortunate start. Cancer is not my origin story either. In the pursuit of telling a good, satisfying, palpable story, I did not get the freedom to explore multiple visions of my own future. There was one path and it stretched on for years, a funnel into the perfect ending to my cancer story. Instead of exploring my interests, I obsessed over cancer and was lauded for my work ethic. No one thought to suggest that this might be a coping mechanism to understand my trauma. Even when I disliked every job related to cancer that I tried. I liked cancer most when I was learning about it, analyzing it at a higher level and connecting it to myself. But how could I tell people I did not see myself in a cancer career anymore? Because I only ever was interested in understanding it to understand myself? Because of trauma? But I am healed, that is the way this story is supposed to go. It is not like I do not have the talent. In fact, I would be wasting it if I do not stay in science or in medicine. It does not matter that I grew a distaste for so many other parts of it. Deviations are unimaginable. But it is imaginable. Kids with cancer can grow up. It is not our duty to make others comfortable with that idea. I do not owe anyone a tidy ending. My ability to heal from my cancer was delayed, not hastened by the story of the long-term cancer survivor. I am not healed! I am tired of pretending that I am. But I will make up for the lost time, now that I can understand that I still bear wounds from my trauma, now that I understand that my story and my trauma did not end when I \"beat\" cancer. I am freeing myself from the shackles of other's expectations. I feel the catharsis that I never found in the last 15 years of my life. I can begin to reintegrate cancer into my life story, but finally on my own terms.

    "data": "By Diane Kaufman Can a person be not okay and okay at the same time? I want the answer to be \"yes\" and I do believe this is possible. I want it to be because I am not feeling okay. The coronavirus pandemic is a reality. Here's a glimpse into my mind's confusion. It starts like this: I am a child psychiatrist and I am supposed to feel and be okay. This is what my \"tyranny of should\" tells me. I mean if I don't feel okay how can I be of help to someone who feels the same or even worse? My inner critic tells me that I should be coping par excellence and not be grappling with anxiety, fear, and sorrow. Or if I do, only a little, not for too long, and it must not interfere with my life. My inner judge also tells me compared with the world's sorrow and families who are burying their loved ones in the hundreds of thousands, what do I have to feel sad or bad about? Don't you feel ashamed of yourself? Stop the insipid wallowing. Who do you think you are? What if your colleagues knew you felt this way? Better keep those thoughts and emotions hidden. Be silent. Show only strength. Be a role model of resilience. I'm a mother and isn't it my job to be strong for my daughter? As a grandmother aren't I supposed to bring happiness and not a hint of sadness when I arrive for my 6 feet away and face mask visit? As a sister what good does it do to share my worry? Won't it make my sister and brother feel worried, too? My friends have their own struggles. Why burden them with my problems? My imaginary problems at best. They have enough of their own problems. Besides I want them to think I'm fine because being fine is being strong. So there goes the closed circle of my mind looping back again and again as it fights against its own sense of real not okay-ness. I want to be okay. I want everyone and everything to be okay. But I and We and It are not okay. When I wrote those words, \"But I and We and It are not okay,\" I could feel the tears begin to well up in my eyes. My tears that I have been so holding back want to pour down and join into the rivers of sorrow that are being felt and lived by so many. Does that make me weak? Does that make me incompetent? Does that make me a failure as a mental health professional? If being okay means pretending all is alright when it isn't, I guess the answer is yes. My mind also has a wiser and more compassionate voice. I want to learn, practice and share a new definition of being okay. That being okay is being okay with not feeling okay. Being strong is accepting I can also feel weak. Being strong is sharing my uncertainty. Being competent is a professional skill that does not erase my being human or make my human beingness irrelevant. There is tremendous relief and freedom in saying what is so. Not hiding from the truth. No longer lying to myself and/or others. I am not okay and that's okay and I know I'm not alone in feeling this way. It's important to honor reality. To stop and feel the enormity if even for just a moment of what is happening in our world. We don't have to be afraid of feeling. Release it a little at a time. Be comforted in knowing you are not alone. Seek care and support wherever that may be - from family, friends, inspirational quotes and books, faith, and from the beauty of nature. We will recover. Life will go on. A vaccine will be created. Social distancing will continue to keep us safe. And all that does not take away the right I have, that we all have, to feel our feelings whatever they may be. I love these words by poet Walt Whitman, \"Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself; I am large - I contain multitudes.\" I will dare and dare greatly by saying I am not okay because saying this aloud respects who I am, makes me stronger, shows my humanity and weaves me into the fabric of life and life's people at this time of the coronavirus pandemic. I am okay with feeling not okay. Resilience is not just about bouncing back. It's acknowledging and accepting that yes, I am feeling down, but knowing this feeling does not mean forever. Once I see and feel where I am without judgement there is an opportunity to soothe the pain by telling my true story, to stop feeling ashamed, to be cared for by another, and to open my heart and mind to experiencing the multitudes of being that I am, the multitudes of being that we all are. This moment now inspires our better tomorrow. Gratitude brings tears to my eyes. Tears shed for joy and not for sorrow. Another contradiction? Not if I allow myself to become large enough to embrace, endure, and accept all that life is. Be Safe. Be Strong. Together We'll Weather The Coronavirus Storm.

    "data": "\"Can you ask my wife if she'll be my roommate if I'm positive?\" Mr. Jones yelled to me through the door of room 32 on Ellison 12. It was the spring of 2020, during the first COVID 19 surge, and I had been redeployed from my usual job as an MGH PACU nurse to work on a COVID unit. So many questions were yelled to me during those three months, as I rotated throughout the hospital, going where I was needed. From behind the glass on White 3, Ellison 3 and Wang 3. \"Can you get me more syringes, pain medication, the blood sugar machine? Can you call the Prone Team? Do you know how to speak Spanish?\" Mr. Jones' question was an easy yet hard one to answer. I started nursing school in the fall of 1988 in the middle of the AIDS epidemic, during a time when everything was changing. I remember my nursing instructors reviewing a new policy of wearing gloves for patient care that involved contact with body fluids. By the time I graduated I recall my first months of practice being inundated with traffic signal colored universal precaution bags outside the patient's rooms. Red for bio hazard linen, yellow for standard soiled linen, and whatever you were unsure of was to be placed in the green containers. I was often afraid that I would dispose of things incorrectly during those uncertain times. How was I to remember all of this as a new nurse? How would I pass my boards? I felt overwhelmed. I am pretty sure the patients did, too. How could they not? At these times, I would remember my father's words: \"Talk to the patients, have them tell you their life stories. Don't let the technical part of your profession make you lose sight of your vocation.\" When I was 15, my father, a brilliant nuclear physicist, told me to become a nurse because, as he put it, I cared about who people are and what made them special. \"You ask people questions and you listen,\" he said. So, I followed his advice and did what I was good at, asking and listening to stories from people in times of need. \"What's your favorite vacation spot?\" I would ask. \"What's the most entertaining concert you have been to? What's your favorite food (outside of the hospital, of course)?\" In 1995, after meeting my husband on a beach while watching a sunset, I moved to Boston to be near him and started working at MGH, where I spent 15 years caring for cardiac patients. Cardiac medical situations can be extremely stressful. I tailored my questions. \"Who makes your heart feel good and how did you meet them?\" I would listen to the answers -- \"my mom\", \"my grandson\" and sometimes even \"my dog,\" followed by the story of why and how they met. These moments of listening to someone share with me a moment of their life that was not filled with fear, pain and anxiety was a connection. A connection that I was honored to be a part of. For the last 10 years I have worked in the post anesthesia recovery unit--the PACU--for patients going home the same day after elective surgery. For me, this nursing environment has been less stressful than I experienced as a cardiac care nurse, yet for my patients it is still quite stressful. I ask the same question just worded differently. \"Who is bringing you home and how did you meet them?\" These stories bring smiles, to me and to the patients who are sharing, and these smiles seem to lessen the post-surgical pain. Now 30 plus years into my nursing career I have come full circle. There is a pandemic. Everything is changing. There are new policies and procedures seemingly changing every day. I am overwhelmed. Patients are alone and fearful, but they have stories and I am good at asking and listening. The day I met Mr. and Mrs. Jones I was the float/helper nurse on a step-down 36 bed Covid unit. I had not provided patient care as a clinical bedside nurse in eleven years. As I walked onto the unit that overwhelming feeling of disorientation I had 30 years ago returned. So many new protocols to remember. Donning and doffing my PPE. Would I remember the proper sequence to keep myself and others safe from this virus? I actually had written a cheat sheet of the step-by-step order on a 2x2 pink post-it note and taped it to the back of my name badge. My MGH ID in a clear plastic sandwich bag I had brought from home. The plastic making it easier to clean at the end of my shift. During my 12-hour shift I was informed at morning huddle that the unit census was full, with one patient--Mr. Jones --alone in semi-private room because his Covid test results were still pending. His wife, who was known COVID positive, was in room 16, bed A, with a COVID positive roommate in bed B. Mr. Jones was in room 32, bed A. Bed 32B was empty. The charge nurse of the day continued on with the rest of the unit updates but I remained focused on her description of \"the non Covid/pending covid\" patient in bed 32A. How isolating that sounded. I had been self-isolating from my family during my deployment. I had already been tested for covid the first two weeks of the surge because I had rash and a sore throat. I knew that lonely, impending doom feeling of waiting for results. I worried about Mr. Jones, a person, not just a case in bed 32A. I met Mrs. Jones in the morning as I administered her medications. She exhibited many of the classic Covid virus symptoms - including body aches and loss of her sense of taste and smell. She also had a noticeable cough and an oxygen saturation of only 90 percent. She required supplemental oxygen and was receiving multiple medications and breathing treatments. As I administered her medication, she mentioned that she was waiting to hear how her husband was feeling. \"I really hope he has a better view than I do,\" she said, as she sat upright in bed. She was slight in size and her enormous black purse, next to her on the mattress, seemed to fill all the space. She kept on taking articles out of her purse and laying them on the bed next to her. She took out her cell phone, looked at it, turned it in her hands. She rummaged and dug deep, pulled out a lip stick, crackers, keys, a small package of tissues. She then systematically put them back into the bag in the same order she had removed them. Watching her fidget, I thought to myself that she must be worried about her husband. The room 16A in the Ellison tower is the room near the stairwell, with no view. If you stand at the foot of the bed and look out the window, all you see is the corner wall of the Lunder building - solid and gray. I encouraged Mrs. Jones to sit in the chair and have her breakfast. With much hesitation and cajolement, she was sitting in the recliner chair within the hour. As I was leaving her room, I asked Mrs. Jones if she would like me to check on her husband for her and if it was OK if I gave him an update on her condition. She replied that she was so exhausted and worried that she would appreciate it if I did. I stepped into the hallway to doff my PPE - removing the disposable gown, the hair bonnet and gloves, everything but my N95 mask which would remain on until my short lunch break, for seven hours straight. The indentations and sore on my nose would last for many days. As I donned a new set of PPE outside the door of Mr. Jones' room 32, I could see blue sky and the Charles River. The beautiful view made me breathe easier. I spent the next two hours administering care to Mr. Jones, just the two of us in his room. Me with gown, gloves, face shield and an N95 mask. Him with just a hospital gown and slippers. I asked my questions. \"Tell me Mr. Jones, how did you meet your wife\" I have no idea how much time passed in that room. Mr. Jones told me how he met his wife at a Red Cross dance. He recalled she was there with her sister. He laughed when he told me she wouldn't dance with him when he asked her. They sat and drank coffee instead. He asked her to marry him two days after they met! He told me how he had gone to be a soldier in World War II. With his return he and his wife raised a family in the city of Boston and now his children lived in the same neighborhood with their children. With all the conversation he became short of breath and required oxygen. \"My wife and I do everything together,\" he told me, \"so I know that we both caught Covid. I really miss her now. Can you ask her if she'll be my roommate if I'm positive?\" Mr. Jones' results came back as positive for the Covid virus at 6pm. My shift ended at 7pm. Before I left, I mentioned Mr. Jones' request to the nurse in charge. \"Only if they both agree,\" she replied. I called into Mr. Jones' room, utilizing the mounted iPad to ask his permission to disclose his results to his wife, as well as to confirm his request. He agreed. After donning PPE once again, I walked back into room 16A to meet the concrete wall view, paling in comparison to the Charles River of 32A. I informed Mrs. Jones that Mr. Jones had tested positive for the virus. \"Your husband would like to propose an idea. If you would like, you can become his roommate in bed 32B. You can recover together, and he has a fantastic view from his window.\" With the smirk of a wife who had been married for 40 years, she agreed. With help of other staff members, we wheeled a masked Mrs. Jones into room 32. Rolling into the room, her husband's face lit up. Looking out to the Charles, she turned to her husband with a smile in her eyes and said, \"I'm here for the view\". Mr. Jones then asked me a question that during this Covid pandemic I was happy to answer. \"Can you see why I missed her?\" I never went back to Ellison 12 after that day. My rotation on the unit had ended. The next four weeks, I cared for Covid patients in the ICU overflow units, the post anesthesia recovery care units that I had worked in for the last 10 years converted to serve this purpose. The patients were ventilated, sedated and really sick. I was fearful, anxious and scared. In my thirty years as a nurse I had these feelings during emergency medical situations, but the moments had always passed. Now, day after day in the Covid ICU, these moments lasted longer. It was me, the nurse, who now needed a sense of connection to get me through. But sometimes I was paralyzed. I remember one evening when I was caring for a patient named Juan, working with my nurse colleague, Bonnie. Every night, Juan's wife would call the unit at a scheduled time for an update on her husband's condition. A medical interpreter would also be on the phone to translate our report into Spanish. Juan was still on the ventilator, too sick to speak for himself. That night, before the interpreter was dismissed, Bonnie asked Juan's wife important questions that I was too overwhelmed to ask in that moment: \"What does Juan do for fun? Does he fish, watch sports? What are his grandchildren's names?\" Juan's wife answered with tears in her voice that we did not need an interpreter to understand. I could breathe again. I asked her \"How did you meet Juan?\" Her reply \"En la playa.\" At the beach. Unknown to me, Bonnie had been asking patient families questions about their loved ones and then creating story board posters for the patient rooms. These beautiful posters were the connection, lining the walls with brightly colored pictures of the patient on vacation, with loved ones, with the names of loved ones written in colorful letters next to the photos. The following evening Juan's room was decorated with a poster featuring a photo of him and his wife. That day, the anxious feeling that had been weighing me down lifted a little. The connection that I had been working to create for my patients for so many years had now been created for me. I finished my shift that day recalling the photo of Juan and his wife at the beach and their smiling faces. Now, the PACU is no longer a Covid ICU. Elective surgeries are again scheduled. I guess we are \"back to normal,\" but not really. Being a nurse during this Covid pandemic has changed me and opened my eyes. I now become more concerned when patients are alone. Where are their support systems? When I ask a patient the question \"Who is taking you home and how did you meet them, \" it's different. Sometimes, the answer is \"I have no one.\" I now take more time than before to help them find someone, so they won't be alone. I am grateful for my peers who do the same, and who ask patients questions that help us see their humanity. I think often of the Jones' and how Mr. Jones' question -- \"Can you ask my wife if she'll be my roommate if I'm positive?\" --brought a smile to my face and a connection to my heart amidst the surge of unanswerable questions.",

    "data": "As I sat on the kitchen floor holding the bottle of pills, my cat Sierra came over for some attention. I set the bottle down and held her, crying. A few days later, still feeling emotionally vulnerable, I determined the exact day I would end my life. I was in 6th grade. I was adopted from Guatemala at 8 months old and have always felt a sense of abandonment and struggled to recognize my self-worth. My single mother worked hard at her job and found good care for me when she had to work. I loved my daycare, but every day when my mom dropped me off, I worried that she wouldn't come back. When I got older and was allowed to stay home alone after school, I felt overwhelmed with anxiety and anger if my mom didn't answer her phone right away when I called. By the time I reached her, I would scream at her, throw things, or stab the walls with scissors. Once, I picked up a small (but not light!) cat perch and threw it against the wall. The hole remains today, a reminder of angrier times and also as a cause for occasional humor as we see our solution to the damage - placing a wall sticker that says \"Peace\" to cover the spot. I was always aware that I was different from my mother and my many relatives. They were white while I was Latina. There were very few Hispanic children in my elementary school, and I was sometimes singled out with cruel comments. \"Why does your skin look like dirt?\" These comments hurt, and while my mom was angry on my behalf, I sensed that she couldn't really understand how these comments made me feel. Then I was diagnosed with learning disabilities. Now, in addition to feeling ugly, I felt stupid. I dreaded the days when I went to the learning center, embarrassed by being pulled out of class. I hated feeling different and struggled to manage my anger. You might think I had a tough home life, but that was not the case. I have a loving mother and extended family, a nice house, attended good schools and had many friends. My grandparents were very important to me, especially my Papa. We always had a unique connection. He made me feel loved unconditionally. One of my favorite memories of my Papa was when we were visiting my grandparents in Florida when I was a little girl. I was in the pool, and wanted someone to come in with me, so Papa dove in. He was a chubby man, and the dive created huge waves. I thought it was so funny! He called me \"Princess\" and made me feel like family and he had total confidence in me. He would tell my mother that adopting me was the best thing that she ever did. My Papa's death when I was in fourth grade was devastating and left me feeling sad and empty. Sometimes, I wanted to be with him in heaven, to end the emotional turmoil in my head. By sixth grade, life felt so hopeless that I decided the only solution was suicide. One of my classmates told my guidance counselor that she was worried about me and I admitted that I had a plan to end my life. My mom took me to the emergency room at Children's Hospital. It was a long afternoon and evening. I answered questions from nurses about what had happened, whether I used drugs or drank alcohol, whether I felt safe at home. I answered the same questions for a doctor who was checking my physical symptoms. I waited and waited to provide them with a urine sample (many cups of apple juice later I was finally ready, but needed my mom to hold the cup for me - we still laugh about me peeing all over her hand). Then I waited some more for a psychiatrist to come talk with me. I talked a bit about how I was feeling, about my grief over my Papa's death, about how I felt like I didn't quite belong anywhere, but after many hours, the psychiatrist and my mom decided I was safe to go home. I wasn't. A week later, I told my therapist I was hearing voices in my head telling me to end my life, and I ended up back in the emergency room. This time, I was more honest about my feelings and the depth of my hopelessness. I was admitted to an inpatient, locked psych unit. I spent the first night on a mattress on the floor, trying to sleep without much success. The next day, my mom came to visit. We spent several hours in a run-down visiting room surrounded by toys and books for younger kids. I cried and begged to go home. We talked about why it was best for me to stay until I could feel safe, and I eventually calmed down. We laughed about silly things, and I was allowed to use my phone so I could text a couple of my friends. I remember feeling sad and homesick. I remember feeling bored, I remember resenting some of the restrictions I thought were stupid (all of the strings had to be removed from my hoodies - because apparently strings are dangerous). I also remember the good things. I knew that I was safe, that I could not harm myself. My mother was able to visit every day. I was discharged after a week. I was not ready to just jump back into classes and homework and friendships. One night, I again told my mother that I did not see any reason to stay alive. There just seemed like no way that I would ever feel anything but miserable. It wasn't until my mother said, \"If you end your life, I would have to end mine too so that we could be together,\" that I started to realize that my life had value. I had felt like I was the only one experiencing intense pain, but I had been blind to my mother's experience of watching me deteriorate in front of her eyes. My suicidal impulses faded but I still struggled. I hated school and by halfway through 8th grade I had missed almost 50 days and was planning to drop out. There were efforts to connect me with different counselors at school, to allow me to eat lunch with a staff member rather than in the cafeteria, to let my therapist meet with me at school, but none of this made enough of a difference. The district finally agreed to let me transfer to a therapeutic school, the Walker Beacon School. As soon as I walked into my new 8th grade class of four students, I knew this would be a much better place for me. The entire staff was trained to help. I was permitted to leave class any time I was overwhelmed and needed a break. One of the counselors would go for a walk with me or sit and let me vent until I was calm enough to go back to class. I met with my clinician several times a week and I knew she had my back (even after I threw a glass jar at her in a fit of anger). My new friends were not put off by my bursts of anger because they were also learning to regulate their emotions. Things were still difficult, but I felt that everyone around me was there to help rather than judge. Even more important in changing the direction of my life was meeting my new therapist, Jamie. I remember sitting in the waiting room when this beautiful Black woman walked in, dressed in comfortable, colorful clothing. She walked right up, smiled, and shook my hand. I felt her warmth and her humor, and I suspected she would not be disturbed if a few swear words came out of my mouth. As we followed Jamie up a set of stairs I turned back to my mom and gave her thumbs up. This one was going to work out. With Jamie, there was no judgment, just understanding. I was finally allowed to express my true feelings - the deeply felt fear of abandonment, my dark moods, my suicidal thoughts and self-destructive behavior, my feelings of inadequacy due to my learning disabilities. Jamie helped me realize that I needed to stop running away from my problems and instead talk about them. She helped me realize there was a brighter future for me, one that I could manage on my own using my inner strength. It was so helpful to have someone (besides my mother, because mothers always say those kinds of things) tell me that I was smart and strong and capable. I learned to see those things in myself. This therapist saved my life. With time, I found increased self-acceptance. Instead of wishing I looked like my White friends with their pale skin and straight hair, I began to love being Latina. I stopped spending hours straightening my hair and let my natural curls show. I also learned to seek out friends who could accept me for me, moodiness and all. I started to understand that my birth mother's decision to place me for adoption may have been a gesture of love, not abandonment. Feeling stronger and more confident about myself made me more aware of times when friends and classmates were struggling. I began sharing successful strategies I had learned in therapy to help them. I became an unofficial peer mentor and realized I liked helping other students. During high school I got a job as a teacher's assistant in an after-school program working with six- and seven-year-olds, many with behavioral challenges. One of my favorite students was a second-grade boy who had frequent outbursts. Sometimes we just sat and talked. I explained why his behavior was not acceptable and gave him time to calm down before we talked about how to get him back into the group play. As a result of the obstacles I have overcome and the experiences that shaped me, I now know I am a strong, determined, compassionate person who has the drive to pursue a career helping others. I am currently attending college to earn a degree in social work so I can help behaviorally challenged adolescents struggling with emotional setbacks. I try to tell my own story with the hope that doing so can change the perception of mental illness. I want people to understand that a person who suffers from depression or anxiety or who struggles to regulate their emotions is still a person who might be funny, smart, compassionate, accomplished. That person can be an effective employee, a good friend, a parent, a teacher - with the right supports people can achieve despite, or even because of, their mental health issues. Life continues to present challenges and there are times of the year when I struggle with depression. March is especially hard because that is when Papa died. But I have learned to fight my way through the difficult times, knowing that those days will pass. Sharing my story with you today helps. So, thank you.

    "data": "By Andrea Gilats, author of an important new memoir,After Effects: A Memoir of Complicated Grief. My beloved husband, Thomas Dayton, died in 1998 at the age of fifty-two, ending his five-month battle with cancer. As you can imagine, my life changed dramatically at that point. To put it bluntly, I grieved intensely for nearly ten years and lived with unresolved grief for ten more. After Tom's funeral, I naively expected that each day I would feel better than the day before, and that after a few months or perhaps a year, I would somehow be myself again. Thankfully, for many of us, that is the course our grief takes. We are able to recover from even our most grievous losses by traveling a relatively straightforward psychological progression from the actual loss (bereavement), to our responses to that loss (grief), to learning to live with our loss (mourning), and to the return to a satisfying life (recovery). Along this path we might encounter ditches and detours, but experts agree that recovery from \"active\" grief is as normal as grief itself. But what if we cannot meet this expectation? What if this so-called recovery is somehow disrupted or undermined? What if these \"normal\" processes take an abnormally long time to take hold? What if they fail us altogether? What if something inside us will not allow us to release ourselves and move forward? These were the questions bubbling up within me as I tried to write about my grief experience.As I wrote, I researched, and eventually, just by chance, I encountered the pioneering work of Dr. M. Katherine Shear, the founder and director of Columbia University's Center for Complicated Grief. Through her work, I discovered that for nearly two decades, I had suffered from a known disorder called \"complicated grief\": acute grief that is abnormally intense and prolonged. Even though complicated grief affects up to one in seven bereaved people, many of them never recognize that the course of their grief is not normal, as I did not, and suffer in silence, as I did. Dr. Shear tells us that grief is considered complicated if it continues to be acute for at least a year after the loss and if the bereaved person is experiencing persistent yearning or longing for the person who has died, a recurring desire to die in order to be reunited with that person, refusal to believe that the grieving person's loved one is really gone forever, inappropriately intense reactions to memories of the person who has died, and \"distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\" For years, I suffered from all those painful, debilitating feelings. I had had toothaches, bee stings, and blistering sunburns; I had had influenza, the vomiting flu, and, as a four-year-old, a burning ear infection. I had had my heart broken more than once, but I had never felt pain, whether physical or emotional, that was so excruciating I could not bear it. Yet after Tom died, the unbearable became real. There I was, feeling that I would either explode or implode virtually every minute of every day, and there was no respite, there was no relief, there was no one to rescue me. I learned then that when the spirit is so deeply wounded, the body can't help but follow suit. Why could I not keep my food down? Why did I feel such extreme fatigue every single day? Why could I not concentrate long enough to make a grocery list? Tom was gone from my sight and I knew what constant sorrow was, but I never questioned these physical changes, even though they were ruling my life. Had I thought to look into it, I would have learned that losing a close loved one is a singularly powerful source of stress, and stress can weaken the immune system. So while grief is not normally viewed as an illness unto itself--after all, losing our loved ones is an inevitable part of the human life cycle--it can make us physically sick. While grieving, we are more likely to catch colds, have our colds degrade into pneumonia, be plagued with insomnia when we most need to maintain our meager energy, and suffer from anxiety that leaves us short of breath, which makes us feel panic, which makes our hearts beat too fast, which makes us feel fear. There is even a condition called broken heart syndrome whose symptoms mimic those of a heart attack, but without permanent cardiovascular damage. Related to broken heart syndrome is the \"widowhood effect\" that most commonly affects older couples and is realized when one spouse dies within months of the other. Researchers attribute this to the fact that grief causes inflammation levels in the body to rise, leading to (actual) heart attacks, strokes, and diseases like cancer that result in premature death. Unfortunately, I was a living example of this phenomenon. I was born with what people used to call a \"sensitive stomach.\" I had lived with off-and-on-diarrhea, as well as related unpleasant symptoms, for most of my life, but I had learned to adapt to my condition. Then, soon after Tom died, my digestive problems worsened precipitously. My daily bowel movements doubled from about six to about twelve each day, and some days I defecated fifteen times. Time and time again, my then doctor tried to diagnose what had become a significant disability. Finally, after seven years of inconclusive tests and failed guesses, she sent me for a colonoscopy, which confirmed that I had Crohn's disease, an auto-immune disorder characterized by inflammation of the bowel. Not only did I have a diagnosis, I was facing the prospect of surgery to remove two and a half inches of what the surgeon called \"diseased bowel\" near my terminal ilium, the place where my small and large intestines meet. Thankfully, I came through the surgery without incident and was sent home from the hospital to complete my recovery. I had been home for only two or three days when I began to feel feverish, out of sorts, fuzzy-headed, and exceptionally tired. I called my surgeon, who immediately sent me for a CT scan to determine whether my surgery site was infected. Abscesses are common after bowel surgeries, and sure enough, I had one. I was sent directly from the imaging clinic to the hospital, where I would receive intravenous antibiotics. I was assigned to the third bed in a room originally meant for two patients. My nearest roommate was a young woman who had obviously been terribly injured. Her face and neck were covered in bruises, and her left arm, including her entire left hand, was wrapped in a thick bandage. Her bed was only about five feet from mine, so I couldn't help but overhear conversations at her bedside. The first of these was between two hospital staff women; one may have been a nurse. As the poor patient rested, awake but silent, the two confirmed to each other that the patient was scheduled for surgery the next morning to have her left hand rebuilt. Apparently, it had been crushed in a brutal beating she had received the night before at the hands of a boyfriend or husband. Shortly thereafter, two different women came to her bedside and began a conversation with her. Very quickly, I came to understand that one was a social worker and the other a translator: my roommate spoke no English, and her social worker spoke no Spanish. Her heartbreaking story was that she had indeed been abused by her live-in boyfriend and was now suffering from the worst of the frequent beatings she had received at his hand. Somehow, she had managed to escape from their home and get to the emergency room, but her toddler daughter was still with him. She could not return to him: she feared for her life. \"What will happen to my daughter?\" she asked, and then, probably rhetorically, \"Where will I go? I have no place to live.\" The social worker assured her that they would be sending child protection workers to get her daughter, and that she and her daughter would be placed together in a shelter where they would be safe. For now, she should not worry; she should just concentrate on her recovery. The social worker assured her that she was safe in the hospital. After this brief interview, the two left, promising to see her again the next day. Moments later, a soft-spoken young nurse came to take my roommate to the bathroom, and having just taken my sleeping pill, I dropped off to sleep. When I awoke the next morning, my roommate had already been taken to surgery. I never saw her again. It was not the abscess at my surgery site that had put me in the hospital the previous afternoon, it was the fact that I was allergic to the antibiotics my surgeon had prescribed. In the light of morning, this obvious fact finally dawned on me. I knew then what I had to do. I left the hospital under my sister's care, discontinued the offending drugs, and within thirty-six hours, I began to feel human again. When living begins to look more promising than dying, it occurs to you at last that through your own suffering, you have learned more about the suffering of strangers, a lesson that your grief had kept from you. You think of the young woman in the hospital, and you feel more acutely how she must have suffered at the hands of her boyfriend. You feel no shame for the attention you paid to your own suffering; you simply start recovering your ability to live beyond it.

    "data": "By Annie Brewster, MD With COVID-19 running rampant and social distancing the expectation, these are unsettling and unprecedented times. Quite suddenly, everything is different. My typically frenetic home life is quiet. No more struggles to get kids up and out the door in the mornings. No more school lunches to pack. No more shuttling my kids to their seemingly endless sporting events, shivering in ice hockey rinks or on the sidelines of lacrosse games. I miss the chaos. I realize I find comfort in this chaos. Now it is quiet and this feels weird and uncomfortable. Many of us are experiencing a new meaning of the word \"togetherness\" as we are cooped up with those close to us, on top of each other with limited diversions. Others of us are alone, trying to figure out ways to fill up our days, perhaps yearning for emotional and physical connection. A friend who lives alone just told me that she has not touched another living being in more than 3 weeks. While this is new for her, I now realize that this is likely the norm for many people even when we aren't living in pandemic times. I have never stopped to think about this before. Professionally speaking, as a doctor on the front lines, I am feeling pretty vulnerable. In general, I have a very high-risk tolerance but now I am scared. At the same time, I am grateful that I have something concrete to do that feels useful. This makes it easier. For all of us, this is a turning point moment. Our life stories have been disrupted and will be forever changed. Nothing is certain. It is hard to plan, because we don't really know what we are planning for. Recently, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of allergy and Infectious Disease, predicted that we might lose up to 200,000 lives to COVID-19 in our country alone. In his words, this pandemic will be \"imprinted on the personality of our nation\" for years to come. How do we cope with this? Or, even better, how can we make this experience psychologically productive, an opportunity for growth? For the past 10 years, in addition to doctoring I have dedicated myself to the craft of storytelling with a specific focus on using narrative as a therapeutic tool for individuals facing illness. At Health Story Collaborative, the nonprofit I run, we define \"illness\" broadly as any imbalance in the physical, psychological, or spiritual well-being, and \"healing\" as the process of moving toward balance and wholeness. Our work is grounded in research that supports the health benefits of narrative and we provide tools to help individuals reflect on and craft authentic, health-promoting personal stories. The current state of the world is certainly one of imbalance, and many of us are struggling. Maybe we are physically ill and worry about being more at risk of infection and complications as a result. Maybe we live with individuals who are ill and worry about spreading the infection to them. Maybe we struggle with anxiety and depression already and are having a more difficult time managing during this strange time. Maybe we are lonely, now more than ever, and feel we have no one to lean on. This is a time of collective angst new to everyone. How can storytelling help us to heal? My belief in storytelling is grounded in personal experience. In 2001, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and this experience taught me some important lessons. I learned that our identities inevitably shift when we are faced with traumatic circumstances, and this includes life altering medical diagnoses and global pandemics! I had always thought of myself as invincible. Nothing could stop me as long as I had willpower and perseverance. I struggled with accepting that I have a disease with no cure and lived in denial for years and only very slowly learned how to integrate this \"brokenness\" into my sense of self. This required me re-write my self-story in a sense. This was hard, but not all bad. I am now living more honestly and authentically. I have also learned how to live with uncertainty. For me, the scariest part of living with MS has always been the not knowing. So far, I have been incredibly lucky with very minimal and manageable symptoms, but I don't know what my future holds. I could be fine, or I could be significantly disabled. MS is a disease with huge variability in terms of symptoms and outcomes. At first, I felt completely out of control and terrified by this unpredictability, but then, out of necessity, I learned to focus on what I could control -- my frame of mind. As holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl said, \"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\" We can't always control the events of our lives but we can control our mindset or how we make sense of what happens to us. We are the interpreters of our lives, the meaning makers. We are ultimately in charge of our own stories. It helps me to remember this during these exceptional times, as the crisis of COVID-19 unfolds. These personal realizations sparked my interest in the power of story. Meeting Jonathan Adler, PhD, now the Chief Academic Officer of Health Story Collaborative, grounded my intuitive understanding in science. I believe this science is directly applicable to what is happening today. I want to share the key concepts with you here, in the hopes that you can apply them to your own lives in real time. Dr. Adler's research is grounded in the concept ofnarrative identity, or the belief that who we are -- our identity --is shaped by the stories we tell about ourselves. It turns out that the stories we remember and choose to tell are the stand out moments in our lives--the high points, low points and turning points. These form the scaffolding of our identity and make us who we are. What we are living through now with COVID-19 is certainly a turning point moment, one we will all remember. While identity tends to be fairly stable over time, it is not static. We are constantly constructing and reconstructing the stories of our lives. Identities shift. Living through this time of COVID-19 will shift and change all of our identities both personally and collectively. While this is scary, it is also an opportunity. Change can be positive. How we tell the stories of our lives matters when it comes to mental health. Some stories do a better job at promoting psychological wellbeing than others. This has less to do with the events on which our stories are based -- or what happens to us -- and more to do with the meaning we make out of these events. We play an active role in this meaning making. Ultimately, we decide what to focus on and how to shape our stories. As Dr. Adler says, we are both the main characters and the narrators of our stories. This is an empowering realization. Certain narrative themes -- namely agency, communion, redemption, accommodative processing and coherence -- are linked to positive mental health. The more these themes show up in our self-stories, the better our psychological wellbeing. Agency is feeling like you have control over what is happening to you; communion is feeling close and connected to others; redemption is seeing bad experiences as having good outcomes; accommodative processing involves revising our existing self-stories in response to new experiences in order to make them meaningful; and coherence is about telling our stories in a way that makes sense, to us and to others. At Health Story Collaborative, our work is centered on trying to help people craft, edit and ultimately share their stories, with an eye toward developing these themes. In general, as human beings we make meaning out of our experiences retrospectively rather than in real time, and most of what we know about the health benefits of storytelling is based on how we tell stories of experiences that have happened to us, rather than stories that are in the midst of happening. With that said, I believe that keeping these principles in mind as our COVID-19 stories evolve can only help us, giving us a greater sense of agency as we navigate these troubling times. Let us all apply these concepts to our lives, both today as we navigate this ongoing disruption as well as in the future, as we sift through our memories and make sense of what has happened. Remember, you are in charge of your story, even if you can't control what is happening. You are playing an active role in shaping your identity. These are hard times, but embedded in this struggle is opportunity for you to change, to become who you are supposed to be. Ask yourself: What can I control in this frightening time? What are my personal strengths and how have these strengths helped me to survive? What can I do to help others in need? Who has been there for me? How has this experience strengthened my relationships? What have I learned and how have I changed for the better? Write this story down and reflect on what has been most challenging. How and why has this required you to change? What does this mean to you? Share your story. Keep writing and revising. This is how you will emerge from this experience whole, with new strength, perspective and self-awareness. This text was originally posted onCaringBridgeon April 16, 2020.",

    "data": "By Charley Rosenberry I was in quite an awful wreck in 1986, involving a flatbed semi truck that swerved into oncoming traffic hitting me head on. The first responding police officer called me in as a fatality. When fire and paramedics arrived, a paramedic got as close as he could to me to determine I was alive. However, the first fire rigs on scene didn't have the equipment to extract me, so called for another station to bring the necessary equipment. While they waited, the paramedic kept encouraging me to \"hang in there.\" Mind you, I thankfully don't remember any of the wreck and these details. I only heard them later. I remember regaining consciousness several days after the wreck. Once I stabilized in the hospital, that paramedic came to visit me regularly. Our relationship continued after I was released from the hospital. When I progressed to mobility out of the wheelchair, I went to the fire station and spent an hour or so with the firefighters and paramedics who responded. Quite a memorable visit. I regretted losing contact with the paramedic over the years. Now, 34 years later, my wife, Lanora, works for the fire department. Since she was appointed MSO (Medical Services Officer) by Pierce County Fire District 13, she has mentioned a Commissioner in the Department who has been especially supportive of her and served as a valuable mentor. I was glad for that, of course. Then, several months ago, I went with Lanora to her Chief's retirement party. Her Chief was highly respected throughout Pierce County, so there were lots of Fire Department brass from Pierce County, including Tacoma Fire & Rescue in attendance. When we entered the banquet hall, Lanora pointed out various people she'd mentioned over the years, including the supportive Commissioner who was across the room. I hoped I'd have a chance to meet and thank him that night for supporting Lanora. At the celebration, I got into a conversation with the MSO of the Tacoma Fire Department. During it, I told him that I owed my life to his Department. He was interested to hear the details. I told him about the paramedic mentioned above, how he visited me and had to leave one afternoon after getting called to another emergency that was rather unique on the Narrows Bridge. When I mentioned the other call, the MSO nodded towards the Commissioner that Lanora had pointed out. The MSO said, \"That's him.\" I went over to the Commissioner. I introduced myself as Lanora's husband. I said, \"And we've met before.\" In over 30 years as a paramedic with Tacoma Fire, he remembered the wreck vividly. Time, location, circumstances... After we were both a little choked up, he regained his tough guy paramedic composure and said, \"Yeah, I remember we told Dispatch, 'We have an AFU.' That's All Fucked Up.\" Since that reunion, the Commissioner and Lanora have become even closer. He could be her biggest supporter - not that she hasn't fully earned his support and that of her entire Department. Lanora and I have spent some good times with this Commissioner and his wife at various Department events, and I suspect we'll have more good times to come. This story lifts my spirits any time and certainly in these times. It reminds me that it is possible that we can make it through the tough times, and that amazing things can happen on down the trail.",

When we spoke just before her anniversary, she marveled at everything being in recovery has afforded her. Originally from New Jersey, Kelly stayed in California after finishing residential treatment in order to complete her college degree at Pepperdine University, where she is now a senior. Kelly developed anorexia when she was just thirteen years old. She spent the following nine years cycling in and out of eating disorder treatment, trying to manage her primary behaviors of restriction and over-exercising. Told by her doctors that she would never fully recover, Kelly became intensely focused on maintaining her identity as a person with an eating disorder, which provided her with a meaning and a purpose. She excelled at her eating disorder. Furthermore, the treatment centers felt like safe havens, retreats from the challenges and uncertainties in life. But eventually Kelly's behaviors took too great a toll: her body, her mind, her spirit, and her family needed to be freed from the depleting cycle. In her story, Kelly speaks about the impossible desire to have just a \"little bit\" of an eating disorder, shares the challenges she has encountered in trying to strike a balance between recovery work and social life, and identifies what keeps her committed to recovery when the road gets bumpy. She acknowledges that recovery is a long process, but she harbors the essential faith that becoming fully recovered one day is absolutely possible.\"",

    "data": "A Conversation with Allie Cashel By Val Walker Allie Cashel is the author ofSuffering the Silence: Chronic Lyme disease in an Age of Denial(North Atlantic Books) and is the co-founder and president of The Suffering the Silence Community, a nonprofit organization dedicated to breaking the stigma surrounding chronic illness and disability. Since starting work with STS, Allie has been invited to facilitate workshops and to speak about disability, inclusion, and storytelling at events around the country. She has appeared in a number of global media outlets, including Good Day NY (Fox5) and NowThis Live News, and has presented her work at a United States Congressional Forum. Introduction Communicating with doctors about a chronic illness takes practice, patience, and honesty. But in a rushed, crowded and hectic medical setting, we often skip information about our symptoms or get distracted and confused. Are we being fair reporters for ourselves about our symptoms and our own nuanced observations? It's a fine, delicate art to accurately and fairly describe what is going on with our bodies, especially when we don't understand it. And worse, if we have multiple chronic illnesses or a rare illness, we could feel overwhelmed trying to grasp what is happening to us. We can barely wrap our minds around the troubling problems our illness is causing in our daily lives, let alone do a good job of describing what the heck is going on to our doctor! Many women like me manage several chronic illnesses at once, which overlap and complicate our symptoms and patterns. For example, I suffer from multiple autoimmune diseases, as well as other endocrine and cardiovascular diseases. Trying to analyze my symptoms can be as delicate as reading tea leaves, yet I must be as fair and concise as possible when I approach a doctor. My radar is on high alert for any sign that the doctor's eyes are glazing over when I try tobrieflyoutline the many overlapping symptoms--I even apologize for \"having so many problems.\" Indeed, my anxiety spikes long before I step into the doctor's exam room. I can feel my blood pressure go up justthinkingabout how to describe my unrelenting symptoms to my doc (\"Here we go again...\") Allie Cashel has struggled with Lyme disease since her teens, and spent years feeling dismissed and misunderstood by doctors. She conducted a series of interviews with Chronic Lyme patients in New York and around the world, revealing a complex world of suffering within the Lyme community. But in the past few years, she sees heartening signs that medical providers are tuning in more to the disease. With her helpful and informative website for living with chronic diseases alongside Lyme disease, she offers tips as well as reassurance for those of us who frequently see doctors while battling chronic illnesses that play havoc with our bodies. 1. Do you think medical providers are \"getting it\" more about Lyme disease these days? Allie:Fortunately, I've seen a difference in the past five years. There is more awareness and a more comprehensive view of Lyme disease. There is a broader understanding about the scope and intensity of the disease and how it affects our lives. I've witnessed how my fellow Lyme disease survivors are not undergoing as much dismissiveness and misunderstanding from doctors about what we suffer. I wrote about this sense of silencing in my first book about Lyme disease,Suffering the Silence. Thankfully, I see changes for the better. 2. What would you suggest for approaching a doctor about suffering a chronic illness, especially if it is a rare illness, or you're dealing with subtle early symptoms? Allie:I havelotsof experience going to doctors with strange, subtle symptoms with Lyme disease. And I have heard from hundreds of patients coping with chronic illnesses with nagging, constant problems. Here is a list of what I think is crucial for sharing information with our providers: Write down your questions in advance--think ahead about what you want to find out and prioritize your questions. Track the symptoms and patterns of your illness, and if needed, keep a record of vital signs (could include blood pressure and pulse tracking, sleep and diet patterns, urinary and bowel patterns, pain patterns, stiffness and fatigue patterns). This might involve keeping a medical journal of the patterns of your symptoms. Research (Google) the treatments for the illness and learn about the illness. Know the landscape of what you need that is \"out there\" for treatment. Help to inform your doctor about the treatments you are interested in. Bring another person with you if you feel you might be overwhelmed or awkward with the communication. 3. What if the treatment is not working or you are not sure what to say to your doctor for follow up? Allie:First and foremost: It is important to be patient and wait at least a few weeks (even months) for treatments to take effect. Continue to track your symptoms. It might be useful to talk with your doctor about symptom relief, at least to help temporarily until more is known. 4. Can you tell me a story about how your organization, the Suffering the Silence community, has helped someone communicate better with her doctor? Allie:Our Suffering the Silence community holds retreats for people to gather face-to-face to talk openly about their chronic illnesses. One of the benefits of our gatherings is that we can problem-solve about communicating with our medical providers and learn how to advocate for ourselves. One of our retreat participants was a woman suffering from endometriosis who felt her doctors had not responded well to her and did not listen well enough. By talking in greater depth and in detail about her problems at our retreat, she became more vocal and articulate about her condition. And best of all, she was able to learn what she needed to look for in a new doctor. Fortunately, some of the retreat participants were able to describe their positive interactions with their own doctors and offered concrete examples of what a healthy relationship with a doctor looks like. And here is the key: We need to ask ourselves, \"What does a healthy relationship with a doctor look like?\" Our retreat participant with endometriosis was able to identify what she needed to look for when choosing her new doctor. Here is a check list of the basic questions she learned from our retreat: Does the gender of the doctor matter to you? (Our retreat-goer identified that she preferred a female gynecologist.) Does your doctor allow you to feel comfortable enough to ask \"stupid questions?\" We need an open-minded doctor--for an open exchange of information. We often suppress our questions because we feel embarrassed that we don't know enough. It's vital that we don't feel judged. Does your doctor take the time you need to fairly describe your situation--more than 15 minutes if you need more? Do you think it would be helpful to bring someone with you to help advocate, ask delicate questions, and retain the information? (For more complicated or difficult visits with our doctors, such as when getting test results or pathology reports, it's normal that we need support when trying to absorb powerful, life-changing information.) 5. Your first book,Suffering the Silence: Chronic Lyme Disease in an Age of Denialhas helped thousands of Lyme survivors find their voice and learn to self-advocate about their disease. I'm excited to hear that you are a co-author with Dr. Bernard Raxlen, a Lyme disease expert, for a new book coming out this July,Lyme Disease: Medical Myopia and the Hidden Global Pandemic.Can you tell us more about this project? Allie:This is one of the first projects of its kind, bringing physicians and experts together from around the world to address the epidemic of Lyme on a global scale. This book acknowledges just how many people and how much need there is to address this issue around the world. Book description:\"Based on years of diagnosing and treating this growing problem in NY City, Dr. Raxlen, together with 'expert patient' Allie Cashel and a team of international contributors, provides a road map for individuals who suspect they have been infected and are lost in the 'medical maze' of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, searching for a diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\" Read more on Allie Cashel's website:www.sufferingthesilence.org Val Walker, MS, is the author ofThe Art of Comforting: What to Say and Do for People in Distress(Penguin/Random House, 2010). Formerly a rehabilitation counselor for 20 years, she speaks, teaches and writes on how to offer comfort in times of loss, illness, and major life transitions. Her next book,400 Friends and No One to Call: Breaking Through Isolation and Building Communitywill be released in March, 2020, with Central Recovery Press. Learn more atwww.HearteningResources.com",

    "data": "Segment II - Clowns, Boots, & Radiation: The Surreal World of College Plus Cancer by Rachel Trachten 1. Egg Salad After the surgery, I begin a course of outpatient chemotherapy. At 18, I'm often the oldest kid in the clinic. There's always plenty of waiting there, and at lunchtime staff bring a cart with sandwiches and drinks. Sometimes volunteer clowns with giant shoes and fake red noses walk through the waiting area, trying to cheer patients up with jokes and balloon animals. Some kids smile, but others are just too sick to care. It's early fall, and I'm waiting with my father. On this particular day, the clowns couldn't have coaxed a smile from me. I haven't seen Zach in weeks, and I torment myself by imagining him at Amherst being pursued by beautiful, athletic young women, all with long flowing hair. In reality, he's been struggling to keep up in an advanced physics class while also traveling with the varsity squash team. I wait impatiently as his letters travel from the Amherst post office to my Brooklyn mailbox. Our correspondence sustains me as a I slog through more chemo, scans, and blood tests. My dad is gloomy too.The New York Timesis on strike, which is close to a catastrophe for him. He's flipping through some other newspaper, sighing and grumbling about inferior journalism. After a few months of chemo, I'm down to about 100 pounds. Most of my hair has fallen out, first in strands and then in clumps. At some point I just pull the remainder out to get it over with. George Michael comes to the rescue once again, referring me to an expert wig maker. When I look in the mirror, it's hard to believe that I'd so recently been a normal teen, wearing my long hair in a ponytail and trying to lose five pounds so I'd look more like a dancer. The lunch cart comes our way, and my dad folds his newspaper. \"Hey, they have egg salad today!\" he says, as if this is a gourmet treat. \"And how about one of these milkshakes?\" He means the cans of Ensure, a calorie-rich drink to help patients keep up their weight. \"I'm not hungry,\" I say. When the chemo is injected into my veins, it feels ice cold and has a nasty metallic flavor. I try to disguise the taste by sucking on a handful of peppermints. \"I could go down to the deli,\" my dad offers. \"How about some chicken soup?\" I know he won't quit, so I take a sandwich. It's cut into quarters, and I stare at the four little squares laid out on a paper plate. It looks like an immense amount of food. My dad has practically finished his sandwich when he notices me barely nibbling on mine. \"You need calories,\" he urges. \"You could eat that little piece in just one bite.\" And I could have, in a different life. But on this day I get through just an eighth of a sandwich and call it lunch. 2. Sherry & Sandy Waiting for the hospital elevator, I might have been a visitor, decked out in my natural-hair wig and hoisting a backpack. I am in fact on my way for outpatient chemo, having come directly from a college class downtown at NYU. (I've enrolled there as a part-time student with assurances from Amherst that they'll accept the course credits.) I like the fact that I don't look like a patient--that I'll escape that role someday and get back to being a normal college student. Just as the elevator doors open, I see Sherry's mom, Sandy, heading towards me. I hold the doors for her, and she smiles gratefully. \"You look good, hon,\" she says. \"You have an appointment today?\" \"Chemo,\" I reply, and she nods. My family met Sherry's months earlier on the outpatient pediatric floor. They'd come to New York from a small town in the midwest seeking help for Sherry's advanced bone cancer. She's just 14. \"Sherry's back in inpatient,\" Sandy announces, as the doors close. \"Oh.\" I know this is bad news. It's just a question of how bad. \"Do you want to come and say hello?\" Sandy asks. \"I'm sure she'd love to see you.\" \"Ok, sure,\" I say, dreading the visit. Sherry is curled up in bed clutching one of those hateful mint-green vomit basins. Tiny wisps of hair stick to her nearly bald head. \"Hey honey, Rachel came to say hello. Can you sit up?\" her mom coaxes. Sherry hardly moves, but she briefly opens her eyes and whispers, \"hi.\" Then she falls back to sleep. \"She can barely stay awake, poor thing,\" Sandy says, pulling the blanket up around her daughter. \"How's school going for you?\" \"Um, it's going well, I'm taking modern art history and Irish fiction,\" I say. As if my choice of classes mattered. \"Well, you stay in school, sweetie. That's so important.\" \"I hope Sherry will get back to school too,\" I say. \"Yes, she will,\" Sandy says, and I nod as if I believe her. I try to think of another topic of conversation, but nothing seems right. \"Well, I should probably get upstairs to my appointment,\" I say, backing out of the room. A few weeks later I ask one of the nurses about Sherry and learn that she died a few days after my visit. 3. A Social Worker and a College Prof My first big setback comes just a few months after starting the chemo. It's the fall of 1978 and I'm in the student lounge at NYU. In the bathroom, I notice that my urine is an odd beige color. I know this probably means trouble. I call Dr. Murphy from a pay phone. It's a struggle to hear her over the chatter of students hanging out and drinking coffee between classes. But I'm pretty sure she's telling me to come right to the hospital. She suspects that I have hepatitis and, as usual, she's right; I'm soon an inpatient again. The days pass in a blur. Sleep, blood tests, nurses coming and going. One day a woman comes into my room and introduces herself as Lynn, a hospital social worker. Fine with me, no needles involved. After going through the basics, I find myself pouring my heart out, telling Lynn all about Zach and his recent letter saying that he loves me. Zach and I have been keeping up a steady stream of cards and letters. I send news of blood and platelet counts along with worries over exams, complaints about the subways, and descriptions of foods I'm eating to keep my weight up. In one letter, I tell him that I'd discovered a new node in my neck and felt paralyzed with panic, assuming it meant the Hodgkin's was getting worse. I'd gone right to the hospital, where Dr. Murphy assured me the node was harmless. Zach sends newsy notes about life at Amherst, describing his struggles with physics problem sets, his wins and losses on the squash court, and a budding romance between two of our friends. What I'm not aware of at the time is how much Zach is suffering. His letters are mostly upbeat, but years later he tells me that he was constantly worried about my health. He describes going to frat parties almost every night, trying to numb himself by drinking beer, and dancing until he's exhausted enough to sleep. He's also falling behind in his course work and asks his Russian literature professor for an extension on a paper. Stanley Rabinowitz is a renowned scholar whose lectures are enormously popular with students. He takes the time to ask Zach about his life, and Zach tells him about my illness. The professor gives Zach some advice that sounds obvious but has a profound effect. \"Try not to worry about things before they happen\" is the essence of his wisdom, and Zach takes it to heart and finds healthier ways to cope. After a few weeks, I recover and leave the hospital, glad to have met Lynn. As an outpatient again, I pop into her office for a long talk or a quick catch-up every chance I get. 4. Stick It! I barely say a word as the curly-haired nurse sticks her needles into my tiny veins over and over, trying to get the required tubes of blood. I always try to be friendly to the nurses, and most of them are friendly right back. Pediatric nurses are accustomed to screaming babies and thrashing toddlers, but I'm someone who can be reasoned with, even talked to as a peer of sorts. The curly-haired nurse barely acknowledges me. She offers no sympathetic smile, just gets right down to business with her rubber gloves and syringe. She doesn't even suggest warming my arm up to make the veins bigger. Then, she becomes increasingly annoyed as my delicate veins roll away from her probing needles. Black-and-blue marks pop up wherever those needles pierce my skin. My response is to burst into tears as soon as she leaves the room. \"Where's your fight?\" I want to ask my teenage self. \"Don't you hate her?\" What if I'd pulled my arm away and simply refused? What if I'd marched out of that hospital for good? 5. New Boots Dr. Murphy is petite and gray-haired, looking more like a midwestern grandma than one of the country's leading pediatric oncologists. I eventually learn that she was one of only two women in her med school class back in 1944. At Sloan Kettering she collaborates with another female oncologist, Dr. Charlotte Tan, who looks to me like a Chinese grandma. I'm fascinated by the way Dr. Murphy refers to her colleague simply as \"Tan,\" as in, \"I'll speak to Tan about that.\" When I become Dr. Murphy's patient, I'm 18 and she's about 60. Just as I'm starting treatment, I'm having terrible insomnia. Won't she please, please give me some sleeping pills? She listens carefully but won't do it. \"If you can't sleep, just rest,\" she tells me. I protest, but she won't budge. As the months pass, we get to know one another. I come to every appointment with a written list of questions, and she always tries to answer each one. She's a pediatrician but treats me like an adult. One day in clinic I show her an itchy rash on both of my legs, from my ankles up to my knees. The rash is getting worse every day, and I'm starting to panic. She studies my legs, and I ask if I should see a dermatologist. \"How long have you had this?\" she asks. \"Just a few days, but it's getting worse.\" She looks over at the leather boots I've left in the corner of the room. Stylish brown boots, very chic. \"Did you just buy these?\" she asks. She picks one up, touches the stiff leather. \"Yes,\" I say, surprised at her interest in my footwear. \"They must be awfully tight around your legs,\" she says, and then I get it. She picks up her prescription pad, scrawls a few words and hands it to me. \"Rx,\" it says. \"New boots!\" 6. Zapped As I'm going through it, the radiation doesn't seem like a big deal. It happens at the halfway mark of the treatment, with three cycles of chemo behind me and three to go. I show up at the hospital Monday through Friday for three weeks running. The visits are quick: I lie on a table under a futuristic-looking machine and the radiation is beamed through me. My chest and back have been permanently tattooed with tiny blue-grey dots to guide the beam. Some patients might have questioned the long-term safety of radiation treatment, but I accept it as something I need in order to get well. I'm relieved to find that it's quick and painless, practically a vacation compared to the nausea and needles that come with chemo. Sometimes I even go out for lunch or to the movies afterwards. Little did I know that what felt like a respite at the time would have such a powerful effect on my future health. Many years later, a renowned cardiologist at Stanford will tell me, \"You got zapped.\" 7. How's it Going? Happy day! Now that I'm halfway through the chemo, Dr. Murphy has given me the okay to return to Amherst. I've spent months lobbying for this, reassuring her that I'll really, truly take good care of myself. \"You college kids never know when you're tired,\" she tells me. But my blood counts improve and she works out the medical logistics with a cancer specialist near Amherst. I'm all set to get back to college life. I'll take a half-load of classes, live on campus, and continue chemo treatments nearby. But once I arrive, I feel completely out of place. I'm surrounded by healthy young adults, the sort who wake up early to jog or swim laps before breakfast. It's February, and most students wear nothing warmer than a down vest, while I'm bundled into sweaters and a bulky jacket. At night I'm exhausted but too anxious to sleep. Zach tries his best to help, but between science labs and travel to squash tournaments, his schedule is packed. Afraid to burden him, I conceal how stressed and alienated I feel. A few close friends know what I'm going through, but what should I reveal to casual acquaintances? When I opt for the truth, some people are effusively sympathetic and tell me I'm \"so brave\" or look at me with pity. Others just change the topic. I hate all of these responses and decide to say less. Whenever someone asks, \"How's it going?\" (a common refrain on campus), I smile and say, \"Good!\" (the expected response). Then, the wig. To take a shower, most students simply walk to the dorm bathroom wearing a robe. I can manage this, but what about the wig? Should I walk down the hall wig-less with a towel around my head? Or should I wear the wig, then hang it on a towel hook? What if someone sees it hanging there? I finally decide to leave the wig in my room. Hoping I won't run into anyone on the way, I scurry to the bathroom clutching a towel around my bald head. I feel nothing like a normal college student. 8. Sisterhood Women take over the men's bathroom at the Holly Near concert that February night. It's 1979, and I'm with Amy, my best friend at Amherst. She and I had hit it off as soon as we'd met, and I love her toughness and honesty. Naturally, Amy joins right in when the women waiting in line decide that the men's room is up for grabs too. Amy and I are enthralled by the music and the proximity to so many like-minded women. We both identify as feminists at a college that has only recently gone co-ed. After visiting the Women's Center during one of my first days at school, I'm surprised by the reactions I get from other female students: \"Why would you go there?\" and \"Don't you know they're all man-hating lesbians?\" That night Holly Near and Meg Christian sing about sisterhood and love and political power. I'm eager to escape into the music and forget that I have cancer. Amy and I can usually talk about anything, but she consistently avoids the topic of my illness. Leaving the concert, she says, \"Let's do a radio show about women's music.\" A friend at the college radio station can help with the technical side. All we have to do, Amy says, is write a script, choose the music, and tape the show. I have no idea how we'll manage this, but Amy is confident. Two weeks later, we're ready to record. It's evening, and snow falls steadily as we enter the studio. I do my best to stay alert, but I'm exhausted from the chemo. Amy is focused on the radio show, and I feel hurt and abandoned as she acts like I'm just fine. Months later, she confides, \"I felt so close to you that I couldn't accept how sick you really were.\" 9. A Small Rash About two months into the semester, I develop a small rash on my left side. It doesn't look like much at first, but it persists, reddens, forms small crusts. I show it to my local oncologist, who sighs and says I have shingles, a nerve inflammation that's common when your immune system is weakened by chemo. He prescribes codeine in case the rash becomes painful. I fill the prescription but assume I won't need anything more than Tylenol. Dr. Murphy suggests I return to New York, but I resist. She reluctantly agrees to let me track how quickly the rash is spreading. Luckily, Zach is not at all squeamish. In fact, the experience of my illness has convinced him to go pre-med, a decision that makes perfect sense given his interest in both science and the humanities. With help from another pre-med friend, he outlines the contours of the rash with a marker to track its progression. By the next day, I'm popping codeine every four hours. And a day after that, the red spots swell and spread into ugly blisters. The rash has more than doubled in size, and codeine isn't enough to ease the pain. My mid-section looks like some kind of ghoulish topographical map. Zach calls Dr. Murphy and describes the blisters and my pain level. \"Put her on a plane today,\" she says, and my semester is over. I fly back to New York dazed and sleepy from painkillers; my parents practically carry me off the plane. We go directly to the hospital, where I'm quickly admitted. Years later, my mother tells me she nearly blacked out when she saw those blisters. 10. Girlfriends I'm finally well enough to leave the hospital. I've been an inpatient for nearly two months, battling shingles, meningitis, and other complications from the chemo. I later learn that my survival was uncertain, but at the time I'm too sick to even wonder about it. During these months, my contact with the outside world is limited to staff and visitors. Once I start feeling better, I take slow walks round and round the nurse's station. Two close friends, Allison and Lisa, are on spring break from college and come to see me. If they're shocked by how frail and bald I am, they never let on. They bring Italian bakery cookies and gently rub my fuzzy head. Many years later, Allison tells me that when she first learned about my diagnosis, her mother told her not to look it up in the encyclopedia, but she did anyway. Allison and I became nearly inseparable starting in sixth grade, and Lisa made it a threesome when we got to junior high. With so much shared history, the three of us can relax and giggle even in a cancer hospital. When the nurses let them bring me out to the deck in a wheelchair, I can almost convince myself we're just out on the town. The day I'm discharged from the hospital, I walk along the Manhattan sidewalk like a country bumpkin gaping at big city life. My dad drives to Brooklyn and stops at a local market, but I stay in the car, watching the scene around me as if it's a movie. People come and go with bags of groceries, small children in tow. I'm feeling sleepy and almost drift off for a nap, but the world pulls at me. I find myself thinking about Lisa and Allison and wondering when they'll come home for the summer. I imagine going out to Sunday brunch and catching up on their lives and dating adventures. Months later, Zach and I rent a basement apartment in Greenwich Village. Before we move in, Lisa and Allison show up with buckets and cleaning supplies and help us scrub every inch of that apartment.

    "data": "In August of 2012, Charlie Atkinson was bitten by a mosquito in the garden outside his home in Cambridge, Mass. From that bite, against the odds, he contracted West Nile Virus. It nearly killed him. Charlie was in a coma for more than a week, paralyzed in his left arm and right leg. He spent more than 400 days total in two hospitals. He is still recovering. Before the fateful insect bite, Charlie, married, with four children and nine grandchildren, was incredibly active. He was an avid tennis player, a self-taught pianist, an educator and entrepreneur who started numerous companies. West Nile Virus changed that life.I met Charlie, now 78, on a snowy December day at his home, now retrofitted with a wheelchair ramp and a stair lift. We spoke in the sunny dining room, which has been transformed into a bedroom, complete with a hospital bed and Charlie's ventilator equipment (he has a tracheostomy and is on the ventilator at night). Charlie lay propped up on his pillows as we spoke, and his warm handshake and bright eyes made me feel right at home. A self-described \"Just Do It\" guy, Charlie fought his way back from near death with amazing determination. He surpassed the predictions of the medical community and has continued to make progress: he can now get around with a roller walker and even take steps on his own with a cane. But beyond his physical comeback, Charlie's story is also about learning to be a smarter patient; questioning the conventional medical wisdom and seeking out health care providers who are truly compassionate. West Nile Virus is an arthropod-borne virus (an arbovirus), most often spread by mosquitoes between the months of June and September. It has been found in 48 states (all but Hawaii and Alaska) and in the District of Columbia. It was first detected in North America in 1999 and has continued to spread since that time. In 2013, the CDC reported 2,374 cases and 114 deaths. With an incubation period of 2-14 days, only one in five people infected will develop symptoms, most commonly fever, body aches, joint aches and other relatively minor ailments. Less that 1% of infected individuals develop serious and at times fatal neurologic illness, including encephalitis and poliomyelitis, like Charlie. While the odds of serious illness are low, the consequences can be devastating. Without any viable treatment options or a vaccine, prevention is essential. West Nile isn't something we typically worry about, but after hearing Charlie's saga, I know I will be more conscientious about covering up, applying mosquito repellent and staying indoors during peak mosquito hours during the summer months. More importantly, Charlie's story has taught me a lot about the power of a positive attitude in healing. In coming to terms with his lasting physical deficits, he also acknowledges that there are some things he now does better than he did before his illness. For instance, in learning to use his hands again, he feels his piano playing has improved. In his words, \"I now hit the notes more accurately than before I got sick.\" Charlie would like to express his tremendous gratitude to the medical institutions where he received his care, Massachusetts General Hospital and Spaulding Hospital for Continuing Medical Care in Cambridge. In his words, \"They saved my life and made it worth living.\" Originally published on WBUR Commonhealth Blog, January 17, 2014 Resources: http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html 1-888-246-2675 is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention information helpline for the West Nile Virus and is open 24 hours a day.

    "data": "By Margaret Marie I was born to teenage parents in Brookline back in 1956. My mother dropped out of high school, my father joined the Marines for two years, then got a job as a police officer. Soon after, another baby was on the way. Neither of my parents were prepared for parenting, adult responsibilities, or marriage. My little sister Brenda was always at my side until I went to kindergarten. I was called \"Peggy\" back then, and kids teased me, calling me \"Eggy.\" When I walked home from school, neighborhood boys threatened to kill me if I walked by their house. I didn't tell my parents. I figured they would tell me to go and fight them. I'd never fought anyone and didn't want to. Instead, I walked home singing at the top of my lungs, hoping I would be discovered, and whisked off to Hollywood. My defiant, booming singing continued until I discovered the library. There I found refuge from the neighborhood tyrants and befriended the children's section of books arranged from A to Z with stories and adventures that were a welcome antidote to peril. Oh, how I loved reading stories that took me to wonderful places again and again. Throughout elementary school, I remember my parents always arguing. My father drank, some, then a lot. When he got in from work at midnight, he brought his work buddies home, and they'd drink and play cards till early morning. My mother looked wicked mad and sometimes scared. Brenda and I would hide in our bedroom, trying to block our ears. He had a dark side, which gave me the creeps. That he had a weapon locked up in the house wasn't lost on any of us. My mom, Brenda, and I were silent about the impacts my father had on us. By twelve, I believed it was up to me to manage my father and protect Brenda. It took me ten years to be able to speak of this to anyone. Suffice it to say that my teenage years were crummy. My mother and I didn't get along much. I couldn't wait to go to college, though I knew I was on my own to make this happen. It was a long time before I felt any compassion for my mother's circumstances or my own. When I left for college, I majored in philosophy & read voraciously. I was very shy and quiet. I lived by the \"two ears, one mouth equation\" and am temperamentally a better listener than speaker. I was fortunate to find my first people - my kin - through friendships with Owen, Steven, and Michele. We shared a house on the ocean in Winthrop after graduation. I soon began working in community mental health when they were emptying state psychiatric hospitals. In my first job, I was the weekend live-in counselor at a group home in Newton. After a year, weary of weekend work, I got a job as a group home director in Dorchester (just 2.5 miles from The Boston Home). Nancy hired me, but wasn't my boss, and we became fast friends. I felt I was on the threshold of a new beginning. It was a time when people in the mental health field were encouraged to go into therapy. Like many coworkers I respected, I went into both individual and group treatments. This wasn't an easy journey, as I had a lot of issues to unpack. For several years, I navigated the emotional and physical tsunami of therapies, finding that underneath this stormy edge, lurked waves of terror and sadness. I continued to learn much through reading, work, and eventual social work school. Slowly the payoffs came, and I felt an emerging maturity and self-knowledge. How great - to trust myself more. After graduate school, I enrolled in a yearlong learning program with seasonal weekend retreats led by a remarkable Buddhist woman. It was so enriching! Through meditation, readings, journaling, my personal spiritual inquiry was taking flight. I felt nascent stirrings of me as wiser as I stretched my personal comfort zone. I felt stronger all around. Before, I felt like I was a product of my past experiences, and never imagined I could have internal peace and quiet. This was a major breakthrough, as I confidently began to embrace my own choices for how I would respond to life's ups and downs. In the meanwhile, Nancy and I had lived together in Cambridge as friends when we were both at Bay Cove. We got involved in relationships with other women, and I moved to Vermont and later Jamaica Plain (JP) with my partner. These relationships both soured over time. I settled in a studio apartment in Somerville, and Nancy and I became involved. Soon, we moved to JP to be closer to public transportation and Simmons School for Social Work. Eventually, we adopted our first dog, Sam, and life was good overall. I loved heading to the beach on days off and bicycling along the Emerald Necklace weekend mornings. We treasured spending time with friends over dinner and enriching conversation. After Christmas, we'd head to P'town for a week, shake away the leftover holiday season detritus, and spend much desired time together. Bundled up in winter gear, we'd go for long evening walks, en route to and from Napi's or Ciro & Sal's for a luscious dinner, after reading the day away. We both were in good health and had work we were committed to. Life was good. Fast forward...... I was 40 when I was diagnosed with MS. I had foot drop, trouble walking, and fatigue. When I saw my first neurologist and described the symptoms, he performed a basic exam: walking toe to heel; holding up each limb as he pushed against them; having my eyes follow his fingers; reaching my arms out far and touching my nose. I felt awkward, self-conscious, clumsy. His staff scheduled me for an MRI and evoked potential testing. At my 2nd appointment, I learned that I had Primary Progressive MS. While I'd heard of MS - I didn't know much of anything about it. I was fortunate to have this doctor, as he was earnest to learn of my interests. There were limited treatment options at the time. He was very honest that the research on the available medication options thus far couldn't demonstrate efficacy, but we did try them out, one by one. They didn't bring me any benefit. We met twice yearly to check in and traded books of Japanese literature. I appreciated his respectful kindness. Over the next six years, my ability to walk deteriorated and I needed to rely on a cane, then a walker, and eventually a scooter. Each change was an adjustment, but I appreciated that they were necessary for me to retain my independence and safety. I applied to the Mass Rehabilitation Commission for support to enable me to continue working. They paid for an outdoor lift to be installed in our backyard, so I could get in and out of our house safely. The Greater New England MS Society generously helped me with a grant that paid for our small bathroom to be made into an accessible wet room. Their assistance was invaluable. It was tougher to deal with the fatigue and weakness, as they seemed to come on quickly. I had always loved spending time outdoors in the sun, but it became treacherous in short order. I had been working as a social worker at Beverly Hospital on their adult inpatient psychiatric service for two years when I realized I could no longer work full time. I changed to part-time, worked out a job share, but eventually had to leave altogether when I could no longer drive. I think that my attitude about having MS has been informed by all the work I did in therapy, building a spiritual practice, the chosen family I built over time, and how I learned to live intentionally. I was committed to focusing on living each day fully and actively and choosing to keep company with positivity and possibility. I was determined to not have MS define who I am and was open to allowing a bit of denial to help me along. Also, I had worked with adults with Serious Mental Illness for 24 years as a Crisis Clinician, in several psychiatric inpatient units, and at Bridgewater State Hospital. I knew that many people live with extensive suffering. My experiences were not of this magnitude by any measure. I remain humbled by what I learned about despair and courage from these adults and their families. Collectively, these lessons have served me well in my journey with chronic illness and disability. Perhaps most importantly, back then and now, Nancy is \"my person\" and I am hers. We have had and continue to share great love. And, in our early 40s, we decided to expand our family! Yes, we were pleased to join forces with the Department of Children & Families (DCF) to welcome and adopt a child. Nancy and I were both 46, when our daughter, Dorothy, then seven, moved in. We were so happy to welcome her to our home! She brought us joy, all the worries new parents have, and such richness. Until she learned to rollerblade and ride a two-wheeler, she loved riding down the street on the back of my electric wheelchair. She also loved waking me up in the middle of the night by knocking on my head. It's hard to be a scared little girl in a new home, on the heels of several foster homes. I was so glad she was knocking on my head for support and to be one of her two newly devoted moms. I had many medical concerns and crises over the years, but I considered them to be mere \"blips:\" something occurred that was like a sucker punch - I was knocked down, wiped out, often requiring intensive care - but I bounced back, ready to move forward with living. I did get seriously ill in 2004 and it was a colossal blip. June 5th was to be our wedding day and in the darkness of 2 a.m., Nancy awoke to find me feverish and unable to communicate. The ambulance took us to the Faulkner ED and later a lumbar puncture revealed I had meningitis. Nancy and her sister Terry made calls to friends and family, as I transitioned from acute to critical status. Nancy later described that they were called into a triage room, with a large team of doctors working on me, asking if I would want a priest and/or resuscitation if my heart stopped. I have no memory of this, or that our friend Chris, the designated officiant of the day, joined us later that day and performed an abbreviated bedside service. Reportedly, I muttered yes and we were married, while the medical team enjoyed the top tier of our wedding cake lovingly baked by Nancy's nieces. Following a week on a medical unit being treated for meningitis and a raging cellulitis infection, I was transferred to a rehab unit at a neighborhood nursing home. I had declined significantly and we needed to set up more supports at home. Two years later, I moved into The Boston Home. I wanted to come to The Boston Home (TBH) before I became a burden to my family. When Nancy and I took a tour of TBH, I smiled throughout the entire visit. There was so much space, the building and grounds were beautiful, and it was a place where people we met seemed to be thriving. I loved the variety of activities and how family members were always welcome. It seemed like a place that could offer me more assistance, resources, and a community. Nancy held back tears throughout the tour, saddened to imagine life in our home without me. She saw only loss - I saw opportunities. It seems unbelievable to me that I have lived at TBH for 18 years now. I was so blessed to have Donna Corbett as my first roommate here, and every day I think of her friendship with a smile. I have grown to love this community wholeheartedly and have been able to live with much richness and joy here. The residents and staff together make this place unique, and my family and I are grateful that Dorothy has grown up loving to come here and enjoy the many best friends she has made over the years. At TBH, I learned to cherish watercolor, to love karaoke, and have shared sacred times in abundance here - with family and friends. How fortunate I am to have witnessed the bravery and dedication of the team throughout the pandemic years and was so pleased to reunite with beloved friends here when isolation restrictions eased. In October 2022, I had aspiration pneumonia and spent two days in the Emergency Department at MGH and because there were no beds, was transferred to the ED at MGH Brigham where they had no beds. After I had another aspiration in the Brigham ED, I was in acute respiratory failure on 40 liters of Oxygen. They had a vent at the ready. I learned from Nancy that I got great care from one of the ICU doctors and head of Pulmonology, until a bed became available. I recall excruciating pain when they worked to get an ABG (arterial blood gas) but remember nothing else throughout my stay at either hospital. Nancy, my medical providers, and our family were pretty worried. Since I didn't remember any of this, I stubbornly wanted to ignore their concerns - as if they were inadmissible hearsay. I had bounced back. This most recent winter was the first time I ever felt completely overwhelmed and afraid when I became ill. While I have had a wealth of MS related challenges, at 67 years old my ways of coping with its exigencies were no longer available to me. I was having episodes of confusion and disorientation, and my brain wasn't functioning well. Then in April, I got sick fast and it cascaded into acute sepsis and delirium. I was in the Carney ED and had to be transferred to MGH for a surgical stent placement due to a belligerent kidney stone. After three days at MGH, I was sent home, arriving here with my Oxygen Saturation level at 50. Back to Carney's ED, diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism and acute respiratory failure. I was sent to the ICU for a week. Nursing staff repositioned me there, and pain exploded, as my upper arm fractured in two. (Advanced MS + functional quadriplegia = severe osteoporosis) - AKA \"shit happens.\" While I learned later that Nancy was with me throughout these days, all I remember is nightmares and fear reminiscent of Dante's circles of hell. Eventually I came out of this precarious state and will forever be grateful for the kindness and expertise of Carney's ED and ICU teams. I may not get the chemistry of the respiratory system in chaos but have come to believe others when they say that hypoxia and CO2 narcosis can result in disorientation, paranoia, delirium, confusion, and nausea. My mind defies me as my once comfy room has been altered; there are spies all about; I am unsafe. Later, I am sequestered on the ground floor with 20 other TBH residents. There is darkness and risk; Nancy + Dorothy are on their way. I can't trust anyone. I am surrounded by familiar people; but I am isolated. I feel kin to the elder Inuit women who in times of scarcity were pushed out to treacherous Artic waters to die on their solo ice floe. I have had multiple surgeries--for breast cancers, tumors, a volleyball of a fibroid, a tear in my spinal cord, etc. and survived them well. I have had multiple admissions to ICUs at Carney and MGH. I've had an abundance of medical specialists, pic lines, transfusions, medications and chemo. I'm well known to the Infectious Disease team at MGH. The Carney ED saved me from death five times. MGH and Brigham and Women's have similarly brought such life-saving expertise. The TBH staff have heroically cared for me through innumerable times of critical need. We stopped counting a long time ago. My family and friends describe me like a cat with 29 lives, instead of nine. I am weary of the ways in which our complex health care system is cumbersome, inefficient, and ineffective. When I received care for sepsis and pneumonia in a local hospital's ED, ICU, and medical unit earlier this September, I had a different doctor every day and night. They didn't seem to share much communication with each other, and some didn't communicate directly with me. It took three days for them to get me the correct meds for spasms and neuropathy pain. I was in a new mattress with reportedly \"great technology\" that used warm heat and a loud fan to keep the mattress particles in continual motion. It increased my body temperature, I was sweaty, uncomfortable, and too weak to move my one hand that still has a bit of functioning. The heat triggered painful spasms in my left leg. They wouldn't turn it off when I asked them to, given concerns of further skin breakdown. I wanted to give up then. I felt so disrespected, dehumanized, and demoralized. I don't think many people can imagine what it is like to be alone and unable to move any part of one's body - not even to move one finger one inch to reach an accessible call light. I called Nancy sobbing. She returned to the hospital, reminded the staff I had the right to refuse the high-tech mattress treatment that was making me worse, acknowledged our awareness of the risks, and unplugged the mattress. She then brought cool facecloths to my head, face, neck, arms, and hands, settled into a chair at the side of my bed for the night, played old favorite songs on YouTube, and we sang and shared stories through the night. I chose \"Don't Rain on My Parade\" to become my new theme song. In the morning, realizing it was a tough song to sing, I switched to \"Oh What a Beautiful Morning\" to sing aloud and restore me to my calmer self. I hereby elect to return to past lessons to live each day I have more fully and positively. Here is my commitment list for myself going forward: I've decided to pay attention to the helpers and loved ones I trust, including myself. Recognizing how helpful it is, I will use my BiPAP machine as faithfully as I can. I've begun listening to Pema Chodron's most recent book, How We Live is How We Die. I'm exploring finding a Spiritual Mentor. I am relishing listening to great music every single day. I look forward to meeting our family's new puppy next week. Her name is Daisy Mari. We already love her. We look forward to sharing her with all who shimmer in the presence of a dog's sweet love and spirit. I will do my best to keep my heart open, spread kindness, and continue to count my blessings each day.",

    "data": "By Braiden Rex-Johnson Television advertisements for well-known disorders such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma tout new wonder drugs that can clear plaque-ridden skin, improve the pain of damaged joints, and help people breathe more easily, respectively. But for sufferers of granuloma annulare (GA), there is no magic panacea that will stop the unsightly red rings, violet patches, oozing plaques, and painful nodules that can pop up anywhere on the body. My own case of GA began in the spring of 2017. I was 61-years-old when a red ring, about the size of a quarter, popped up on the back of my right hand. The ring was slightly raised and a bit itchy. At first, I dismissed it as an insect bite or a pesky skin eruption and hoped it would just go away. But on an otherwise ordinary Saturday afternoon, while we were sharing fajitas at our favorite Mexican restaurant, my husband asked about the strange circle on my hand. It was then that I realized I needed to see a doctor STAT. My primary-care physician thought the circle might be ringworm. But when a course of antifungal cream didn't help, she prescribed a strong steroid cream. Even that didn't faze it. And within weeks, I watched helplessly as red spots about the size of nickels started appearing on the backs of my pale and--until then--blemish-free legs. I watched in growing alarm as a smaller red spot sprang up on the outside of my left knee; then one on my right elbow. My skin was turning into a Modernist painting before my eyes as the angry red bumps spread over my extremities. What were these strange spots? What if they spread to my face? I had always taken good care of my skin, choosing unscented products, moisturizing my body, and slathering on sun screen, so why was it turning against me now? I made an emergency appointment with my long-time dermatologist. He agreed that my condition was most likely GA. To confirm the diagnosis, he anesthetized one of the most prominent bumps, then \"punched\" a small plug from its center. After examination by a pathologist, this \"punch biopsy\" confirmed that I had GA, and all of this just six weeks after the pesky red ring first appeared. My dermatologist suggested starting intralesional corticosteroid injections with a drug called Kenalog. He said he hoped the under-the-skin injections would make the bumps go away, or at least calm the inflammation and help them fade over time. Injections?!?!I had always been afraid of needles, and there were so many places to inject. The thin needles in the Kenalog-filled syringes moved over my body like a swarm of angry bees stinging their way across my torso. Sensitive places like the backs of my knees, under my breasts, and near my groin especially hurt. Sometimes I flinched and grimaced, unable to control my body movements. To help ward off the pain, I often held my breath and pretended I was elsewhere. When the torture was over, I looked down at the examination table and saw red spots--my blood--spattered on the protective white paper where I had just laid. Although painful and unpleasant, the \"jabs\" became a necessary evil. I remained ever hopeful that they would make my GA go away, since my dermatologist kept predicting that it would most likely \"burn out\" within a year or two. But it didn't. The injections helped flatten the bumps and lighten the patches, but new lesions would simply pop up in different places. One time, after undergoing what seemed like hundreds of \"jabs,\" my doctor said that injecting me \"was like a game of whack-a-mole.\" Granuloma annulare is an ugly disease, both literally and figuratively, affecting both mind and body. The uncertainty and unpredictability of this disorder--knowing it is roiling deep inside your body, ready to spring up anywhere and at any time--is one of the most unsettling and frustrating things about it. Somehow, my precious husband of 40 years manages to see past my imperfect exterior. And a kindly nurse once said one of the patches looked like a butterfly tattoo! Still, I can't imagine being diagnosed as a child, trying to navigate the dating scene, or going through GA alone. I am thankful we live in the Pacific Northwest, where I can hide my spots most of the time. Since my diagnosis more than four-and-a-half years ago, I have learned a lot about GA, which translates from Latin as \"inflamed ring\" and is more correctly known as necrobiotic papulosis. The \"inflamed rings\" of GA were first reported in 1895 in theBritish Journal of Dermatology. According to a recent article in theAmerican Journal of Clinical Dermatology, it is a rare disease, affecting just .04% of the United States population. Women are three times more likely to suffer from it than men, it most often occurs in the fifth decade of life, and is more prevalent among Caucasians. The exact cause of GA is unknown, although some believe it is a result of trauma or injury to the skin (such as an insect bite), sun exposure, viral infections, or vaccinations. People with GA sometimes also suffer from thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. The good news is that GA is neither cancerous nor contagious. The bad news is that some people experience pain, itching, burning, and perforations in their skin. Granuloma annulare most often appears on the hands, wrists, feet, and ankles, although sometimes even on the face. It comes in different forms. The localized type often occurs in children, the rings are confined to one area, and sometimes it goes away spontaneously. Subcutaneous GA, also mainly seen in children, is less common and appears as rubbery lumps. Perforating GA forms crusty yellowish plaques, mostly on the hands. The patch type presents as pink, red, or purplish patches and usually affects females over the age of 50. Generalized, or disseminated GA is diagnosed when a patient has more than 10 spots. More common in adults, generalized GA tends to be more persistent, is difficult to treat, and can last for decades, sometimes never resolving. Because the underlying cause of this disorder is unknown, finding a gold-standard treatment that works for every patient is difficult. I have tried first-line options, including steroid creams and injections, and a third-line treatment, phototherapy (treatment with strong lights) without success. Through my research, I learned that certain prescription drugs have helped resolve some recalcitrant cases of GA. However, many dermatologists (including my own) are reluctant to prescribe them because they have not received FDA approval for use in GA, clinical trials are small or nonexistent, and side effects can be serious. But after suffering for so long, I was getting desperate. And when my husband said he would be willing to \"go to Mayo Clinic or anywhere else in the world to get me fixed,\" I knew I had to do something drastic. Thankfully, we didn't have to travel far afield. In January 2022, I found a dermatologist at a local teaching hospital who was willing to prescribe an oral drug called Hydroxychloroquine (yes, that Hydroxychloroquine!). Although it is more commonly used to prevent or treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus, Hydroxychloroquine has shown promise in patients with tough cases of GA. My new doctor explained that while steroid injections can help, they don't address the underlyingcauseof GA. After explaining possible side effects (atrial fibrillation and retinal problems) she advised me to start taking Hydroxychloroquine twice a day for four to six months, and return for a three-month check-up. I was overjoyed! If it worked, it meant no more fiddling around with creams, injections, or light therapy. But the first doses were tough. Nausea, dizziness, and unsettling dreams lasted close to a week, but eventually my body adapted. I am already seeing improvement, but even if Hydroxychloroquine doesn't work or eventually stops working, my doctor said there are other drugs to try, always walking the fine line between side effects and efficacy. Late last year, I discovered the Granuloma Annulare Support Group, a private Facebook group that was started in 2015 and now numbers close to 8,000 members from across the globe. Although this is a group none of us ever wanted to join, members are compassionate and caring. Sharing stories and photos has improved my mental attitude and helped me realize I am not alone. Misery loves company. When members were asked to describe GA in one word, the answers were heartbreaking: Evil, annoying, constant, perplexing, creeping, depressing, life-changing, relentless, unwanted. Granuloma annulare is all of these and more. Yet the promise of systemic drugs offers GA sufferers something that is often in short supply: hope. And maybe someday, GA sufferers like me will be able to turn on the television and exult in advertisements that tout our very own wonder drug.

    "data": "By Kaitlin Kerr I've always been close with my little sister. Growing up, we were in the same dance classes and shared the same bedroom. We even ended up going to the same college. We were never bothered by the sameness, the closeness. We enjoyed each other's company. Much to the dismay of our mother, after driving through three states to a family party, we'd ignore the sea of uncles and grandmothers and cousins. Always ending up hiding in a far-off corner. With a bounty of stolen cookies from the dessert platters. Sitting cross-legged on the floor, muddling our special party dresses. Giggling together. Despite the fact she's exactly three inches taller than me (but it's okay, I wear four-inch platforms), I've always understood what it meant to be the big sister, to be looked up to. I understood my role as a companion, a confidant, and a role model. Knowing she was there, watching me, made me better. I refused to talk negatively about my body, knowing we share the same figure. I refused to make myself quiet, knowing we share the same roaring laugh. I refused to bite my tongue, knowing we share the same wit. Soulmates are the people in our lives that we have an unexplainable affinity for. We love them, as if our beings were meant to unite. Honestly, I don't know if I believe in soulmates. Truth be told, when it comes to love, I'm a \"Miranda\"-level cynic. But isn't it a nice idea? That two souls can intertwine. Were meant to intertwine? The summer I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (garnished with Acute Anxiety Attacks), I wasn't exactly a big sister. I wasn't exactly a person. It was after my first year away at college and got bad once I moved back home. By then, we weren't sharing a room anymore. I cried almost every day. Sometimes I'd hide it, silently reclusive in my bed. Sometimes I'd burst in the middle of dinner. Sometimes it was in the car. Most of the time it was without reason. I spent most of that summer in a black hole. Our dad thought I should try some drugs to help calm me down. Our mom thought I was too young for Xanax. I was nineteen years old. My eyes permanently tinged red and patched blue. She was sixteen years old. And somehow, she knew what I needed. I remember one particularly bad evening. I was comatose with my eyes open, swaddled in sheets soaked in the stench of a showerless week. Sometimes the safest thing to do when you're like that is just lay down and teach yourself how to breathe. She came into my room with the night breeze, carrying an offering of sweet peach tea. Her long golden auburn hair still dripping from the shower. Seeping and staining her white cotton pajamas. Then instead of tenderly sitting at the foot of my bed like she was visiting a hospice patient, the way my mother did, my little sister belly-flopped herself on top of me, the way I used to when we were kids and I was up before her on Christmas morning. She never asked why I was upset. She never asked me not to be. She met me where I was, and made sure I wasn't alone. I was almost too numb to care back then. Almost. I still knew what it meant to be looked up to. I was supposed to be her companion, her confidant, her role model. What kind of role was I modeling if I couldn't get out of bed? I could've told her that I was seeing a therapist. That I was taking bright orange and green pills. She probably wouldn't have cared. Hell, she'd probably be happy that I was getting help. But I am not immune to pride. She still saw me as her big sister. Her confidant. Her companion. Her role model. I couldn't show her the world inside my mind. My earliest memory is picking up my little sister from the hospital. I was only three at the time. I'm not sure if this is a real memory, or if I've fabricated it through secondhand stories and dreams. I remember the ride in my aunt's minivan. Listening to the radio instead of my mom's familiar show tunes CDs. The grey plastic leather of the seats. The not-my-mom's car smell. The layer of my cousin's Cheerio crumbs encrusted into every crack and crevice. I felt the same kind of nervous excitement I imagine dancers feel before they go onstage. The kind of apprehension and subtle fear, anticipation and joy. My mother had read to meI'd Rather Have an Iguanaevery night for the past month. It's a cute little picture book about a sassy stubborn older sister who is simply not happy about having a younger sibling, but despite the little girl's best efforts, her parents decide to go through with it anyway. Although I did not share the protagonist's proclivity for reptiles, I never resented the idea of sharing my life with another person. Perhaps I am exceedingly lucky, or perhaps this happens with all siblings, but I feel as though I've shared my life with her. Not in milestones or rites of passages, per se. In the way we share the same figure, laugh, and wit; we share the same character, morality, worldview. I remember walking into the yellow where my mother lay, glowing in the warm autumn sun. The glint of the gold wire on her old glasses. The exhausted and ecstatic energy. I remember my mother in a voice like honey telling me that she missed me. I remember my father holding a bundle of cream blankets. Him telling me that she might look like my baby dolls back home, but my little sister was not a toy. I remember reaching out for the bundle. Holding her for the first time, supported by the hands of my anxious father. I remember being surprised by how warm she was. Feeling her body expand with each breath. Knowing she was small and fragile and precious. I remember loving her. Soulmates are the people in our lives that we have an unexplainable affinity for. We inexplicably love them, as if our beings were meant to unite. I continued to live past that summer. And the summer after that. Recently, my little sister confessed that she was thinking of therapy herself. In stumbling phrases, I attempted to describe how she helped me. How she'd somehow known I needed to be sat next to, brought offerings of sweet tea. How I'd wished that I had been more open about what was happening inside my mind. In her own stumbling reply, she explained that she'd never have asked for help if I hadn't gone first. I understand now that I was never in danger of losing a soulmate. It took time and therapy and tears, but I've been demoted from Major to Dysthymic depression. Slowly, I became able to acknowledge and speak about the world inside my mind. It's a little scary at first, but hopefully with enough jokes sprinkled in, you'll understand too. I explain how the orange and green pills make me feel. How to find a good therapist. How to use your support system. How to ask for help. To be a confidant, you must share your own secrets. To be a companion, you must open your own soul. To be a role model, you must share your own tears. Accept offerings of blankets and tea. Let your soul intertwine. Let your heart burst.

    "data": "I have a friend who works for an insurance company, just like her mom did for over 35 years. Surely, overhearing all those conference calls must have influenced her. One of my best friends is going to medical school. She will deny it in an attempt to see herself as independent, but it is because she wants to be like her parents, who are both doctors. My other friend is majoring in pre-law; it is no surprise that she grew up watching her father defend clients in courts. Children often follow the paths of their parents. There is an intangible level of influence and shaping that happens from the environments we are in. My father sold cocaine out of the local town bar he owned while evading taxes for a living. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I grew up as a kind child who always spoke respectfully to adults and whose teachers saw me as responsible enough to deliver the attendance sheet to the office some mornings in elementary school. I was a good kid, who worked hard in school and played nicely with others. I am also a demon who was easily enraged, who wanted to solve problems with fists, who started drinking only a couple of years after reaching the benchmark of double-digit ages. I grew up mainly in my mother's house, who is, by all accounts, the average suburban middle-class mother. I spent some time at my dad's house, and it shows. I am not sure where I stand on the nature versus nurture argument. Maybe my father's genetics created this conflicted monster, or maybe it was my court-scheduled visitation that cultivated delinquent urges. I can't say for sure where it comes from, but my incessant frustration as I suppress one of my identities is palpable. When I was about nine years old, I was told that alcoholism is genetic-- I'm fucked. What age does alcoholism start? Surely, a desire to deal drugs and hang around seedy bars must be genetic, too. When do I start carrying my weapon for protection? I grew up asking myself when the bad side would set in. I thought about how disappointed my mother would be to see me follow my father's path, instead of hers, despite her tireless efforts to protect me from his influence. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I was ready to branch out and meet new people after being tired of the same old judgmental faces in middle school. I was 13 and ready for something new, and I immediately found a group of upperclassmen that was uniquely fun. Each of them came with their own issues of problematic families, struggles to graduate school, or trauma from sexual assault. Regardless, I enjoyed their care-free spontaneity that let me experience their impulsive joy. One night, I came home around three in the morning with a bloody gash on my leg. I tried to hide it from my mom, but she saw the stained paper towels in the trash. \"Megan, what is wrong? Why are these paper towels covered in blood?\" she asked with aggression and worry. After stopping by to pick up the shrooms my friend Stef was buying, we decided to go TP a house. The cops pulled up, so I ran into the woods. I slipped on a muddy patch and my leg got cut. But it's fine because the cops didn't catch me. \"We were playing basketball yesterday and I got fouled and fell so I cut my knee,\" I said, a little too quickly. I could not bear to see the mournful look on my mother's face if she knew the types of activities I considered fun. I was not ready to host the funeral for the successful child she tried so hard to raise. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My knee healed and I continued to act recklessly with friends during my first year or two of high school. After this, my older friends graduated high school. This left me more time to spend with other people, mostly my high school soccer teammates, who valued good grades, loyalty, and liked to watch movies on the weekends. In an attempt to fit in, I bought fuzzy flannel pajama pants to watch movies at their houses. I started to fall in love with the comfort of the cotton pants on Friday nights. I traded in the minty flavor of Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey for Junior Mints, and the pungent smell of pot for a lavender diffuser. Moving forward, teachers began to see me as a hardworking athlete and not a careless kid, wasting intelligence and athleticism. At times, this identity felt stable. Other times, I craved the exhilarating experiences of my early high school days. Ultimately, I began to root my identity more deeply in wholesome behavior, rather than recklessness. This became a constant for me until graduating high school. It remains a piece of my identity, with only a few interruptions during moments of stress and change. These moments have become shorter and less frequent as I convince myself of my identity. The last time I had the urge to drink heavily to tolerate the stressors of life was yesterday. The last time I drank heavily to tolerate the stressors of life was four years ago. My interest in becoming the shady character perched on the local bar stool with an oversized black backpack filled with various illegal substances has subsided. My need to solve problems with violence is usually nothing more than a fleeting thought. I do not act the way I once did. I do not partake in the activities I once pictured myself destined to do. I am 23 years old. I earned a scholarship to play college soccer and I am graduating with a bachelor's and master's degree in criminal justice. With my degree, I will soon prevent crime, I will rehabilitate individuals from their poor choices, I will guide youths who feel their family has set them up for failure. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My experiences are not unique. Every day there is a child struggling to suppress their conflicting identities. I've learned it is possible. While nature and nurture shape us, they leave us with options. No one is helpless in the path of their lives. Each day we must choose to be the person we want. We are so much more than a product of our genetics and environment. We have the agency to choose our own outcomes--destiny is a multiple-choice exam.

    "data": "by Rachel Trachten Section I- A Fateful Haircut: Diagnosis & Surgery 1. Every Last Hair Oddly enough, it's a guru of long hair who leads me to baldness. It's 1978 and I'm 18. My dad's girlfriend, Susan, is a regular at George Michael's Madison Avenue salon, where they specialize in long hair. She and George Michael are old friends, and Susan has brought me here as a special treat. We've had a delicious afternoon of pampering and long-hair luxury, complete with fragrant orange and pink potions for washing and conditioning. Once my hair is clean and silky, I stand in front of the mirror for a trim. Just a trim, because long hair is the goal. But as I stand there, dark spots appear in front of my eyes and the world starts to close in. I go down, and next thing I know I'm on a black leather sofa in George Michael's office. Before immigrating to the US and becoming a hair tycoon, George Michael had been a medical doctor in Russia. When Susan tells him how I'm still exhausted from the mono I had months earlier, he urges her to push for more testing. Soon after that hair salon episode, I have a biopsy of a swollen gland in my neck, revealing that I have Hodgkin's Disease, a cancer of the lymphatic system. As it turns out, even oncologists like to get their hair done. Cancer specialist Dr. Lois Murphy is also a longtime client of George Michael. He makes the call that gets me on to her patient list, and pretty soon the chemo she gives me will knock out every last hair on my head. 2. Back on the Court Just before I have that fateful biopsy, the surgeon tries to calm my fears: \"I hear you're a tennis player,\" he says. \"Don't worry, you'll be back on the court in no time.\" \"Could I play by the weekend?\" I ask. \"Doubles should be fine,\" he says. Liar. I need the biopsy because that big swollen gland in my neck just won't go away. I've been exhausted for weeks, maybe months, but I'm 18 and keep pushing through. I've never been seriously ill, and how could I be? I'm an athlete with big plans to join my college tennis team. When I get the biopsy results, I'm stunned but strangely calm. I take it all in, including my parents' assertion that this illness is serious, but can be treated. Decades later, I can't help but wonder how a less compliant teen would have handled it all, someone more like my sister, Jessica.\"Cancer!?\"she would roar. \"No fucking way! I'm a jock. And how could I play doubles after that lying surgeon slashed my neck open?!\" She would slam doors and throw dishes, relishing the crash as they hit the kitchen floor. 3. The Bracelet The plastic hospital bracelet feels like a declaration of ownership: you belong to Sloan Kettering Memorial Cancer Center; get used to it. But once the bracelet is secured on my wrist, I'm set free until evening. I head out with my parents (they're divorced, but friendly) for a few hours in Manhattan before returning to face the prospect of the next day's surgery. At this point, I've finished just one semester at Amherst College. I'd missed what should have been my first semester thanks to the mono. But now I'm supposed to be back on track, feeling fine and choosing courses for the coming term. Instead, doctors are going to remove my spleen, an organ I didn't even know I had. For good measure, they'll take out my appendix too and probe my insides for more evidence of cancer. It's a warm July day, and we end up on the sprawling steps in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The area is packed with tourists and New Yorkers enjoying the sunshine, eating ice cream, watching street performers. As I stand a few feet from my parents, someone taps my shoulder. \"Rachel, great to see you!\" It's Andrea, a casual friend from Amherst, smiling and looking perky in a yellow sundress embroidered with tiny white daisies. \"How's your summer going?\" She looks tanned and healthy; she's practically glowing. I pull on my sleeve to be sure the hospital bracelet doesn't show. Should I state the grim truth? \"Things couldn't be worse. I have cancer.\" I don't say this. I stare at a thread hanging from one of those cute daisies on her dress and imagine giving it a tug. How far would it unravel? \"The summer's been good,\" I say with a forced smile. \"But I've got to go; some people are waiting for me.\" 4. Broken That evening my parents are with me in the hospital, and at some point I have a few minutes alone with my dad. He looks as broken as I feel. We sit in my hospital room as the sun goes down. I don't recall exactly what I say, but I must have used the word \"despair.\" And he kind-of snaps to attention and shakes his head like he means it. \"No,\" he says. \"Now is not the time to despair; it's the time to fight.\" I give him a teenage \"oh, come on,\" look, but he insists. \"If there's ever a time for despair, I'll be right there with you,\" he says, \"but this isn't the time.\" His words glue me back together, at least in that moment. He offers up a reminder that he'll be there no matter what and that there's still hope. At 18 I already have a strong belief in working hard for what I want--it's how I got into Amherst and how I win tennis matches. My misery lifts slightly as I take in his words and start to focus on what's ahead. 5. Good Books Night falls, and the Manhattan skyline glitters outside my hospital room window. My parents leave, and I stare miserably at the bright lights and skyscrapers. Then I decide to take the plunge and call Zach, the guy I've fallen hard for at Amherst. When I first saw Zach, he was in our dorm library sprawled on his back on an old sofa. He looked irresistible in a white tracksuit with thin black stripes down the sides. He was reading fromThe Complete Works of William Shakespeare, a weighty hardcover edition that he held overhead like a paperback. I asked around and learned he was a varsity squash player, a sport I vaguely associated with high-end prep schools. It certainly wasn't on anyone's radar at my public high school in Brooklyn. I also heard that Zach had a bit of a reputation as a playboy, but I wasn't scared off. A few weeks after we met, he asked me to dance at a Valentine's eve party and the chemistry between us was undeniable. When we sat in the same lecture hall or I spotted that white tracksuit across the campus quad, I felt his presence like an electric charge. One night we took a midnight walk around campus and kissed by moonlight. I soon learned that Zach had grown up in Northern California, where his dad was a physicist and his mom worked in public television. His West Coast childhood was as exotic to me as my New York roots were to him. When the semester ended, Zach and I parted for summer with the quasi-commitment \"try not to fall in love with anyone else.\" I headed home to Brooklyn, and he left for California, then back to his mom's current home near Boston. Now it's July, and Zach has no clue that I've just been diagnosed with cancer and will have surgery first thing in the morning. We'd been writing occasional letters that summer, and I'd mentioned that I was having a biopsy. But neither of us took it too seriously, assuming it was just something I was doing to appease my parents. I set off in search of a pay phone, clumsily pushing my IV pole down a hallway decorated with cheerful museum posters. I'm on a pediatric floor and most of the children I see are bald. I try not to think about what that means. Some of these kids also have amputated limbs and are getting around using crutches or wheelchairs. As I slowly make my way toward the phones, doctors and nurses in bright scrubs bustle past, miniature teddy bears clipped to their stethoscopes. I'm trembling as I dial Zach's number and try to explain the train wreck my life has become. \"Hodgkin's Disease,\" I say. \"It's a cancer of the lymph nodes, but they say it's curable. The surgery is tomorrow.\" Silence hangs between us. \"So, um, what else have you been doing?\" he finally says. \"Have you read any good books this summer?\" Good books?!We end the call soon after that, and I sob against the cold hospital wall. Why would he want a girlfriend with cancer? 6. Love Medicine I'm stuck in the hospital for two weeks after the surgery, and Nancy is my main nurse on the day shift. She's good at her job, but mostly it's her love life that helps me through those depressing days. Post-surgery, my abdomen is covered by a large bandage with stitches underneath. I have a tube in my nose, an IV needle in my arm, and pain meds every few hours. The saga of Nancy and her boyfriend offers something to focus on other than my own misery. Nancy lives in New York, but she's in love with a guy in Boston. They've been in a long-distance relationship for almost two years, and, at 30, she's more than ready to get married. But Boston won't commit. He's content with the status quo, where they see each other every few weekends. Nancy is starting to doubt his love. Meanwhile, there's a New York guy who adores her, but she's only lukewarm on him. It's my daily bit of fun to hear Nancy's latest drama. And she's eager to hear my boyfriend blues too instead of just taking my temperature and blood pressure. When Zach announces that he's coming to visit, Nancy and I have a long conversation about which nightgown I should wear. In the moment, it's an important choice, and she turns out to be good medicine. 7. Nurse or Supermodel? My mother stays with me in the hospital after the surgery. There's a cot for her next to my bed, though I can't imagine she got much sleep. I'm aware that my mom has terrible fears about hospitals. But I'm a typical self-centered teen and don't give it much thought. I do know that my mom had tried to visit a friend in the hospital but had to leave almost immediately because she felt faint. Perhaps she never even made it to her friend's room. And now Sloan Kettering is her second home. Somehow, she copes. One post-surgery night, I awaken with sharp abdominal pain. Please, let it be time for more painkillers. No, it's too soon. My mother goes in search of the night nurse, who turns out to be a glamorous blond. I can't help but admire her chic angled haircut and the tiny diamond studs in her ears. But something about her cool elegance makes me think she'll tell me to tough it out until I'm due for pain meds. My mother explains what's been happening, and the nurse listens closely. In a soft voice, she asks me to show her exactly where I'm hurting. Then she gently rearranges my body to help ease the pain. She gets extra pillows, putting them in just the right places under my legs. The nurse promises more meds soon, but I'm already feeling better. People can surprise you. 8. My Own Prince Charming After telling Zach about my diagnosis in what feels like a disastrous phone call, I try to resign myself to the end of our relationship. In an attempt to protect him, well-meaning friends and relatives also suggest that he let our romance end. Recovering from Hodgkin's Disease is far from a given in 1978. In fact, the protocol I'm getting is barely beyond the experimental stage and is being tested only at Sloan Kettering and Stanford Medical Center. Dr. Murphy tells my parents that this combination of drugs and radiation is beginning to show good results, with cure rates as high as 75 percent. I'm unaware of these statistics, but I do know that my disease has progressed to stage IV, having spread to several parts of my body. Zach ignores the advice to stay away. Instead, he calls my father and arranges a visit. About a week after my surgery, Zach gets on the Eastern Airlines Shuttle and into a cab and appears at the hospital. I'm so excited and anxious about his visit that I exhaust myself before he gets there. I'm sound asleep, probably snoring, when he arrives. I open my eyes and he's standing there in khaki pants and a striped button-down shirt, his hair nearly blonde from the summer sun. I forget about my pain and tubes and stitches. Whatever Sleeping Beauty felt when she awoke to find Prince Charming beside her, I'm sure it was nothing compared to my joy in that moment. For a while, we make small talk about Zach's flight from Boston. Then we cover his recent visit to California, where his father lives. The issue of my illness feels too dangerous to touch. Finally, we tiptoe up to it. \"I won't be back at school in the fall, with all this going on,\" I say tearfully, motioning toward my body, the IV pole, the room. \"I know,\" he says. He sits by my bed and holds my hand, and, after a little while, I doze off. Rachel Trachten appreciates life in Northern California, where she works as associate editor forEdible East Baymagazine.

    "data": "By Katharine Greener-Hage I was born in Calcutta, India, where I was born with a rare form of Congenital Muscular Dystrophy called Rigid Spine Muscular Dystrophy, which is a non-progressive form of muscular dystrophy. When I was 3 months old, I was adopted and moved to the United States. I was not officially given my diagnosis until middle school, after having scoliosis. From there I went to see several specialists at John Hopkins in Baltimore and had two muscle biopsies. I also had to start wearing leg braces, a back brace at night for some period of time, and to go on bipap at night. All of these changes occurred during middle school, which made it especially challenging to go to many doctors and know I was different from others around me. It has been hard for others to understand that I will never be able to be fully independent or to do all the physical things that my friends and family members can do. But I always believed that I should still stay positive and appreciate what gifts and talents I do have. My specialists at John Hopkins are knowledgeable and caring doctors who have continued to see me from youth to adulthood for monitoring and checkups. They are always there for advice or assistance by email or phone for any non-emergency questions, which has been especially helpful during COVID-19 since I am at higher risk due to my pulmonary/breathing issues due to my congenital muscular dystrophy. If I got even a mild case of COVID, we don't know if my respiratory lungs would handle it okay without going into the hospital. We just don't know how many risks I should take now. My doctors cannot answer all of my questions or decisions. Growing up with Congenital Muscular Dystrophy has had a big effect on the way I emotionally and physically think about myself, and on how others often look upon me. I know by having this diagnosis I will always be different from most able-bodied people around me, and it's hard at times to accept that. I do try stay positive and do the best to live my life and remember there are others out there dealing and living with other illnesses. I have tried to stay positive and resilient, even though during COVID it has been hard for me to have stay home most of the time. It is hard for me hearing and seeing other people getting to go back to traveling, shopping, eating out etc. when I still have to be restricted to staying at home. But I have continued to keep in touch with friends, make art work and cards for others, do puzzles, watch sports and movies, spend time with my cat, and listen to music. Even though I have muscular dystrophy I still am a smart, educated person and a hard worker who overcame several struggles growing up but was able to graduate from college with two BS degrees. I became fluent in ASL, living with my sister who is Deaf. But my muscular dystrophy has changed some of the goals and passions I wanted or would do if I did not have it, like living independently on my own, driving, having a full-time job, playing sports, and having kids. I discovered that full-time work was too hard for me to continue, but hope to find work in the future that is right for me. Having muscular dystrophy has made it harder to be in relationship, connect with peers, and maintain friendships. I have not really dated or met the right person yet. I have some close friends that I can do activities with, but since I don't drive and they work full-time jobs I can't always see them, and with Covid-19 have to still be home, too. I was hoping to be married or living with a roommate by now, and not still with my family all the time. One of the hardest things about having muscular dystrophy is knowing I won't ever be fully independent like my friends and family. Spirituality has played a significant role in my life. As a sick infant born in India, I was baptized in the hospital because my parents did not know if I would live. I have attended church my whole life and Christian schooling with religion classes and youth activities and retreats. I like listening to Christian music and have attended some music events. I have a Minister who has been coming weekly in person or by phone to talk or just listen in times of need, another person I can talk to who is not a family member. I find it helpful when facing family issues or stressful times. I also have had pastors and friends visit me when I was hospitalized. Listening to Christian music makes me feel better on hard or lonely days. Sharing the word of God with my close friends is also comforting, adding to the good friendships in my life. One of my fondest memories is from when I was a Muscular Dystrophy Ambassador at several events before Covid-19, such as a special dinner and silent auction in Maryland. I hope to continue to be a disability mentor or ambassador and share my story with others in the future. In facing my muscular dystrophy, I have learned how important it is to me to show others that I am strong, positive, and important just like everyone else is, and stand up for myself. In sharing my experiences with others, I hope they might get a better understanding what it is like living with an illness. Katharine Greener-Hage was born in Calcutta, India and adopted when she was 3-months-old. She was born with a rare form of Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (CMD), which is a physical disability that affects her stamina (walking and standing), strength, lung capacity and breathing. She currently lives in Maryland.",

    "data": "By Jennifer Pustz I have so much to be thankful for. I should NOT feel so horrible. But, I did feel horrible. Lost. Lonely. Exhausted. Often. I was a sophomore in college. 18 years old. I had spent several nights crying, not knowing how to get rid of the dull ache I felt inside of me. Now I was on my way to an intake session at the University Counseling Center, at the suggestion of my best friend. I had tried my best to hide my sadness, but having struggled herself, she saw right through me. I skipped my history class to make this appointment, trading time in a class I enjoyed for an hour that was one of the scariest of my young life. I sat in the corner of a slightly dim room with a box of Kleenex in one hand, sobbing and spilling out my inner emotions to a woman I had never met. After 45 minutes of listening, she suggested regular counseling. An appointment was made for the next day. I was so terrified that I almost called it off, but I knew I had to be brave, so I showed up the next day and weekly thereafter. It seemed to be helping, but then, after the third week of counseling, one of my closest friends seemed to turn on me without explaining why. He just shut me out. Suddenly. I was mad, confused, and hurt, not sure if I wanted to go on. I cried so much in therapy that afternoon--all I felt was despair. I could only imagine that he stopped being my friend because I was so messed up. Too much of a burden. I was still the nerdy bookworm I had been in high school, but being at the university had opened my mind to new ideas, people, music, art, and lifestyles. It was exciting but at times overwhelming. I was a perfectionist, not satisfied with any grade lower than an A. As an Honors Program student, I was constantly surrounded by overachievers like me. By the time I entered counseling, I had pushed myself harder academically and emotionally than ever, so hard that I bottomed out. Nothing I did felt good enough. Slowly, over months, my counselor helped me to see and appreciate who I was becoming. Things would be OK, I thought. Things were OK, at least for the rest of my undergrad years, but anxiety and depression were never too far away. I went on to grad school, still never feeling good enough. As the first in my family to graduate from college and pursue an advanced degree, I constantly compared myself to fellow students who went to better schools and came from families with more wealth and status. I was afraid I would be \"found out\" as the fraud I assumed I was. Every night, as I tried to go to sleep, my mind would swirl with thoughts of all the things I could have done differently, better, often reliving mistakes made years earlier. I often wished that I would fall asleep and never wake up. There was also a lot of good happening in my life during graduate school. I fell in love and got married. I had a job that I enjoyed. But still, even when things were going well, I knew that eventually depression would find me. It felt inevitable. I was in my late 20s when I first discussed my depression with my primary care physician, and she suggested I try an antidepressant. In my mind, this marked for me the moment of my \"official\" diagnosis of depression, even though the feelings had been longstanding. Now that I had been labeled with major depression, I had the comfort of a diagnosis and potential treatment, but also a fear that I was now associated with a condition that carried a great deal of stigma. How was this stuff going to change me? Could it really work? Would I need it the rest of my life? Did needing antidepressants to function mean that I was too weak to deal with problems on my own? The first two weeks on Wellbutrin were difficult. I felt like someone had turned up the volume in my brain. I had trouble sleeping. Every so often I involuntarily twitched. I was afraid to tell the doctor. What if she took me off of the meds and I lost this opportunity to maybe get better? And then, about two weeks later, the buzzing in my head stopped. One morning I woke up and everything felt \"even,\" as I came to describe it. The internal criticism stopped. I could fall asleep and started sleeping a little more soundly. It felt like a miracle. I finished my Ph.D. two weeks before my thirty-second birthday. Before I knew it, I had been offered what I long described as my dream job, and my husband and I moved to Boston. Everything about every day was new and exciting. I was happier than I thought I had any right to be. I was gliding. But not for long. Depression continued to haunt me as I spent time in and out of therapy, on and off medications, feeling okay and not okay. My last serious relapse in 2011-2012 was the scariest. I would often cry riding the train to work, wiping the tears from my face, trying not to call attention to myself. When I couldn't take the pain any longer, I started therapy again, got my meds changed, and again, began to work toward feeling more even-keeled, but it took much longer this time. Sometimes I just wanted to disappear from the earth. I came home one night, curled into a ball on the ceramic tile of my bathroom and behind that closed door shaking and sobbing as quietly as I could so that I would not scare my husband. Although I was generally quite open about talking to my family members about my depression, more often I felt the need to hide my pain. They did their best to support me and I did not blame them if at times they felt helpless. At the same time, I felt guilty for causing them worry, broken because I could not seem to get better, and exhausted from living in a world I felt was filled with more pain than I could bear. In early 2013, I decided I needed to find a new approach to managing my recurring depression. Although my symptoms had subsided thanks to regular therapy and medication, I feared another relapse, and I didn't want more or different medications. Before moving to New England, I had a regular tai chi practice and was experimenting with mindfulness and meditation, both of which had helped me deal with the stress that tended to trigger depressive episodes. My search for similar experiences and training led me to the Benson Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. I signed up for an eight-week session to learn the Relaxation Response that would begin on April 16, 2013. The day before the program was scheduled to start was a sunny Patriot's Day morning. I arrived in Boston at the time I would normally have arrived for work, but instead made my way to my volunteer assignment for the Boston Marathon. I had been volunteering at the race since my first year in Boston. As a recreational runner myself, it is a great way to support the running community, and something I am always honored to be part of. This year I would be working at the first water stop after the finish line. I was ready for a long day on my feet, first turning the caps on the water bottles to make them easier for the runners to open, and then handing them out with a smile and congratulations as runners moved through the stretch along Boylston Street after finishing. I was surprised at how physically beat up many of them looked--some encrusted with sweat or bleeding in spots where they had been chaffed by clothing. Faces winced as legs hobbled slowly forward, a situation I could relate to only too clearly, having finished the Chicago Marathon about six months before. Some runners were in better shape and had the smiles I expected to see. Just being there to help these runners was a very emotional experience for me as I shared with them all the joy and pain of finishing 26.2 miles. Hours passed. I watched the numbers on the runners' bibs get higher, indicating that we were getting deeper into the field of over 25,000 participants. My feet and lower back started to hurt from prolonged standing. I remember looking at a clock on a Boylston Street building that read 2:00pm. My anticipated check out time was still 4 hours away. At 2:50 pm, as I was looking down Boylston Street toward the finish, I heard an explosion, followed by a plume of smoke, then another explosion. Fireworks, I wondered? The runners continued down the stretch and because I was so used to seeing battered bodies, I could not tell from their faces what had happened. And I was afraid to ask. Then I saw a female runner coming toward us with a look of horror on her face. Soon, the emergency vehicles began screaming down Boylston Street toward the finish, an area that was now a cloud of smoke and blinking lights from emergency vehicles. In a world where news and information are available almost immediately, there was a void--no one knew what was going on. Speculations and rumors spread. Then, one of the first responders asked us to clear the area. They were looking for a third unexploded bomb. All I remember is a sense of unreality as the scene unfolded around me. I wanted to help but was afraid to help at the same time. No one knew where to go but someone told us to go to the Fairmount Copley Hotel, located on the other side of the Square. I cut through Copley Square, running behind the big white medical tent to the corner across from Huntington Avenue. The hotel was in lock-down. Emergency personnel were pushing people on stretchers toward waiting ambulances. At 3:20, the first of many text messages started arriving from friends and family, those near and far. Where was I? Was I OK? A volunteer wearing one of the white jackets designating her as medical staff approached me with a man in a wheelchair, a thin but very fit middle-aged man, with sandy brown hair and a beard. Michael. He was shivering in his thin runner's singlet and shorts and was desperate to get his gear bag back, which contained warm clothes. The medical staff had been treating him for stress fractures after he crossed the finish line. He did not have a phone - could one of us text his wife to let her know where he was and that he was OK? Then Michael and I were alone. I sent the text \"I am with Michael - he is OK - are you OK?\" I still don't know if that message ever made it to her. I'm not sure how long we waited at that corner across from the medical tent but at some point I decided I needed to do something, to take action and make sure that Michael reconnected with his family. I decided to wheel him to the family meeting area and try to find his gear bag so he would have some warm clothes and his cell phone. For such a lean runner, he was much harder to push than I expected. As we came to the end of the block, there was a rough spot in the curb cut. I hit it with a thud, knocking Michael forward and practically out of the chair. He reacted with an expression of pain. Until then I had managed to keep my emotions in check, for the most part, but now I started to cry and my hands began to shake. \"I am so sorry,\" I told him, and I was. All of a sudden, I realized where I was, what had happened, and what I was doing ... Now Michael comforted me. I needed to take my mind off of what was immediately happening, so I asked Michael to describe his wife to me. \"She has brown hair. She's beautiful, and she should be wearing a brown coat,\" he said. We got to the family meeting area but she was not there. My heart sank. I told Michael I would not leave him until he was back with his family. In the meantime, I would retrieve his gear bag. Amazingly, not only did I find the school bus that had brought his bag back to Boston but the volunteers actually gave it to me to take to him. I returned to the meeting area and was overjoyed to find Michael's wife standing next to him. When he saw me carrying his bag, Michael exclaimed, \"My angel!\" His wife and I needed no words of greeting as we reached out to one another to hug, sobbing with relief, for what seemed like a long time. When I was certain that there was no more I could do to help Michael and his wife, we said goodbye. I wandered from Back Bay to my office on Cambridge Street in a state of shock, stopping regularly to respond to a steady flow of text messages coming from friends, family, and coworkers. As I opened the door at my workplace and saw one of my coworkers at reception, I let out a series of sobs that shook me to the core. Everyone who was in the building at the time came down to the lobby to see me, hug me. I called my husband. My supervisor drove me home. All I could do was crawl into bed. Not surprisingly, the Benson Henry program did not start the next day as scheduled. There was too much uncertainty about travel in the city. The people responsible for the bombing were still at large. By the time the program started, one week later, I had spent seven days feeling completely numb, going through the motions of life. I can hardly remember it. But I still remember the first guided meditation in the program clearly, a body scan, and how good it felt to finally find some brief moments of peace in my own body. The next seven weeks brought more meditation experiences, opportunities to share the impact of these practices with the group, and to listen to the stories of others who had sought this program for a whole variety of reasons. The most valuable part of the program for me was learning to recognize cognitive distortion and negative automatic thoughts and to reframe them in positive and constructive ways. The many years of \"should,\" statements, all-or-nothing thinking, perfectionism, and other unproductive ways of thinking, slowly dissipated. I was extremely sad when the program ended, so I was thrilled when the group leader asked if I would consider helping the next group as a peer counselor. Participating in the program again, in a different role, was perhaps even more enlightening for me. Now that I wasn't focusing as much on myself, I was able to see how profoundly these practices impacted others. In addition to learning how to meditate, I was also motivated to restart my tai chi practice, and eventually pursue a teacher training program at a local studio. My relationship to depression began to change. As part of the Benson Henry program, we talked often about gratitude and making meaning. I had always been careful not to take things for granted, but after the Marathon Bombing, every day felt like a gift. I had walked away from the scene with my life and my limbs when others were not so fortunate. I was determined to find some way to bring some good out of this tragic event. If that day was going to change my life, it was going to change it in the very best way possible. For the first time in my life, depression was not a hurdle to overcome, but part of me that I needed to accept, for better or worse. By acknowledging it and realizing how much the associated pain contributed to my capacity for kindness and empathy, I have been able to better cope with the occasional \"funks,\" none of which have escalated into the relapses I previously experienced. Feeling gratitude is key to helping me understand and accept depression as part of what makes me the unique person that I am. I began longing for new and meaningful challenges, opportunities to further explore and understand my own health and wellbeing, and the chance to improve the lives of others. I had a nearly 20 year career as a historian behind me and was our household's primary wage earner. The decision to go back to school to study nutrition and public health was both the easiest and most difficult decision I have ever made. But I had to do something. I often thought about Michael. At first, I had been so afraid to take charge of the situation, but I did. I met that fear and it changed me. I made a difference. I could do it again. In May I will graduate from Tufts University with a dual degree in nutrition communication and public health. I have been befriended and supported by a community of scholars and researchers who have given me extraordinary opportunities to learn and grow. I am excited to see what comes next. I am truly blessed. I have SO much to be thankful for. And I feel wonderful.",

    "data": "Quilt for Emalia Brown, 25.5\" wide x 25\" high Machine quilted and hand stitched with organza overlays and beading By Gillan Wang: This quilt was made for Emalia Brown, a high school friend from Maui, where we both grew up, after she was diagnosed with stage IV cancer. The news of Emalia's illness came as a terrible shock. I created the art quilt to raise money to help defray her escalating medical costs and to work through my own sadness and demonstrate my compassion. She died while the quilt was in process, and It is now being donated in her honor to benefit her preschool aged son, in the Kahalakea Guard Educational Fund. The format of the piece is based on a traditional Hawaiian quilt, but differs in that it tells the story of Emalia's journey, and our shared connections to Hawaii. Traditional Hawaiian quilts typically feature a solid geometric plant-based pattern, appliqued onto a high-contrast solid fabric. The geometric pattern that I created is based on the silhouette of my friend from a high school year book photo. The reference is specific, yet her identity is intentionally ambiguous. (Emalia's trademark is a flower behind her ear, which is discernible in the silhouette). I used sheer fabric for the silhouette/geometric shape, atop many colorful fabrics that collectively evoke a sense of water, marine life, flora and fauna - all of which we both love. The sheer fabric allows the imagery below to read through, thereby allowing for multiple readings, and suggesting an elusive state of existence. The words grace, love, peace and eternal are embroidered on and around the geometric form, in English and in Hawaiian. While I was driven by sorrow to create this quilt, I aimed to express a more upbeat message of love, peace and acceptance. The creation of this artwork helped me to come to terms with a very upsetting loss. Initially I was overwhelmed by my sadness, but eventually this project helped me to reflect on the positive attributes of my friend, which we will forever celebrate. It also allowed me to feel empowered by taking action to help my friend's family in a tangible way, as opposed to feeling helpless about an unfair situation. Artist Statement: My work is primarily mixed-media, with a recent focus on art quilts. Most of my work is inspired by life's poignant experiences, such as newborn children, parenting and loss. I am especially interested in establishing a narrative in my work, which invariably informs the aesthetic of a piece. I enjoy creating and considering multiple interpretations, and I take pleasure in exploring concepts and ideas using a variety of materials in unexpected ways. Whimsy, bold color schemes, text and found materials often characterize my work. I grew up on Maui, Hawaii, which heightened my aesthetic sensibilities and appreciation of color and the natural environment. I have a deep love of diverse materials and for working with my hands. I have a BA from Bard College and a Master's degree in Architecture from Syracuse University, which expanded my capacity to think spatially, and introduced me to many concepts that I now explore in my artwork, such as layering and transparency.

    "data": "By Braiden Rex-Johnson The skin is the largest organ in the body. And when something in the body's largest organ goes awry, it can create havoc in a patient's life. I suffer from a skin disorder called Granuloma Annulare (GA). It is characterized by red circles, raised spots, pink and purple patches, crusty plaques, and subcutaneous bumps. Parts of my body look like that of a burn victim; others areas like a leopard. I liken my skin to a Modernist painting. For the most part, I try to hide myself from neck to ankles under long-sleeved shirts and full-length pants whenever I leave the house. But out of the ugliness of GA can come beauty when photos of the bumps and patches are turned into watercolor-like \"paintings.\" If you look hard enough and let your imagination run free, you can discover a fascinating collection of objects among the patches and lumps on the landscape of my ever-changing skin.",

    "data": "By: Keisha Greaves You'd be surprised what you take for granted. Those things you don't even think of but are naturally a part of life. Like now, in COVID times, when we aren't allowed to hug, or even see, our friends. My feet were planted on the low-cut grass in the outfield, my usual spot. A girl from the opposing team took her stance at bat. She squatted and furred her brow with focus. When the pitcher released, her bat met the ball with a powerful smack. It whizzed far to a place where I knew I could reach it. I squinted my eyes and leapt toward the ball, making the best (and only) catch I'd gotten all season. \"OUT!\" My fellow teammates cheered in excitement as I smiled from ear to ear. It was time for our turn at bat. Afternoons in elementary school were spent this way, on the softball field swinging my bat and gleefully whizzing from base to base until I stole home. Stealing bases turned into stealing glances at crushes as I ran between floors for classes at my rather large high school. Before I knew it, I found my second home at Framingham State University where I spent my days in fashion and merchandising classes, sewing bold pieces for the runways (leather polka-dot blazer combos and tulle lined mini-dresses are some of my favorites), planning Fashion Club events and making tons of friends a long the way, especially in Black Student Union. My nights were equally eventful as my girls and I got dressed up to Beyonce blasting in the background and made our way to parties and events. I loved to sew, modelling my designs from the likes of Kimora Lee Simmons and Betsey Johnson - my favorites. My admiration for Kimora came during the peak of the Baby Phat age. Her line was of bejeweled and her clothing was embroidered with her signature Siamese cat logo - often in gold. I loved that she was a boss that had it all. She managed her business and clothing line and never tried to hide the fact that she was a mother. Betsey was the funky that I needed in my life. Her style was bold and unexpected. I adored her for her layered prints and the creativity that embodied her inner child. I'd always been recognized for my style, a casual yet chic mix, and in part, I owe it to those two. I adapted my looks in my own ways, often times pairing a creative tee with a blazer or strutting around campus with an eye-popping, eighties-inspired dress, extra tulle with a dash of cheetah print. I was living my life on my terms and loving it. I was Keisha Greaves: agile, loving, creative daughter, sister and friend. After college graduation, I found myself back in my home town of Cambridge, Massachusetts to earn my MBA. While in school, I put my bachelor's degree in Fashion Merchandising to work. I was an independent merchandiser for a company, travelling from store to store to ensure that brands were represented accurately in their respective places in department stores and boutiques. Having this job was a dream come true. It was something I loved to do, and the flexibility allowed me time to make it to my classes and study for my second degree. One day, I'd been walking around the supermarket with my mother and sister. We'd been chatting and shopping, basking in the quality time of the necessary task, when out of nowhere I tumbled onto the floor. It took everyone by surprise, including me. As I sat on the cold grocery ground, my legs seemed to have left the rest of me. It felt like they'd betrayed me, and the rest of my body was upset about it. I became dead weight. I couldn't lift myself. It was the most confusing experience I'd ever known. My mind told my limbs to do something that they just wouldn't do. I needed my mom and sister to help bring me to my feet. I chalked it up to needing to lose weight and did my best to brush it off. I was sure that was the issue. Until it happened again, and again and again. My legs felt weak and I was always on edge that I would be on the ground without warning or my consent. Then, my arms followed suit. I remember lifting my arms to reach for a snack in the kitchen cabinet. That feeling of perplexity and frustration from the grocery store returned as I struggled to make my hand meet the box. Then it happened during my regular exercise time, too. I popped in my \"Walk Away the Pounds\" DVD. Following Leslie Sansone to step up, step down, slide, then - I couldn't reach. I couldn't understand it. I felt like I was fighting against a ton of weight pushing my arm back down. Something wasn't right. My mom and I agreed that I should go see a doctor. We made an appointment. And then another. They both asked me to do the same: sit on the table and raise your leg. Both times, I couldn't. I still told myself that I just needed to lose weight, but the looks of concern on their faces as they lifted my leg for me made me worry. After seeing an orthopedist, I saw a neurologist and then the real work began: testing (and a lot of it!). The EMG required sticking a needle in my legs and moving them about the muscles to see how they reacted (and I had to do that not once but twice!). I was asked to keep still and calm as I was pushed into a tight tube for my MRI. The EKG had me hooked up to a bunch of pads and wires. The entire process was draining and uncomfortable, but the biggest test confirmed my diagnosis: the muscle biopsy. It was a surgery that I was wide awake for. On my back on the cold operating room, they injected my right leg with anesthesia. I made sure not to move as they sliced it open and extracted a chunk of my muscle. It was weird to be awake during this time. If it hadn't hurt so much, I probably would have tried to reach out and touch the muscle sample as they prepared it for diagnostics. They closed everything up, gave me a pair of crutches and sent me on my way. I thought I'd be going to class that evening, like usual, but the pain and grogginess of the surgery proved otherwise. I was bummed to have to share the process with my teacher; before I did, none of this had seemed real. But it was certainly becoming all too real. About a week later, I got a phone call that would change my life as I knew it. Dr. Wang's voice was firm. She declared that I had muscular dystrophy; Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) to be exact. The phone call lasted a couple of minutes. She'd share more about it when we met next in person. I hung up and rushed to Google. I had to know what this was, what it meant and what on earth would I do. I learned that this particular type of muscular dystrophy impacts the body from the shoulders down to the legs. I learned that most of the folks with muscular dystrophy are males and are usually diagnosed as babies or during adolescence. I learned that it's progressive and that there is no cure. I was in a mix of disbelief and confusion. \"How long am I going to live?\" I questioned. \"Will I have to be in a wheelchair?\" I wondered. I shook my head \"What if she's wrong? This can't be my life. It has to be something else,\" I finally decided. I began to shut everyone out - sinking into my new reality and the onslaught of feelings that came with it. I was a very private person, keeping most things to myself and only displaying a bubbly personality with lots of laughter. I didn't feel much like laughing now, so I buried myself away. My immediate family members were my support. I'd read that a healthy diet and exercise could help keep my new situation at bay so my cousin and I joined Weight Watchers. I spent time with my mother and sister. My mom accompanied me to doctor's appointments. I made it to class, sometimes on my own, other times with a cane. I continued to work as a merchandiser, as long as I was able. I lost 36 pounds and I felt like I would be able to somehow conquer this thing! I only realize now that I was still in denial about it for a few years after I received that phone call. I thought I could diet and exercise it away, ignoring the reality that it was a progressive and all-encompassing disease. Though I walked with a cane many days, whenever I had an important meeting or interview, I'd tell the manager I'd recently sprained my ankle or had gotten into a car accident. I never wanted to verbally acknowledge what was happening. I confided in a close friend about what I was experiencing. He encouraged me to let the cat out of the bag. Hesitantly, I opened up my laptop and just started spilling out my thoughts onto a page. It wasn't until I was stroking the keys non-stop that the truth finally set in my heart. \"Wow, I have muscular dystrophy,\" I thought. Then, I said it to myself. \"I have muscular dystrophy.\" It was like a weight was lifted from my mind. I read what I wrote back to myself and with the new acceptance of truth, I thought maybe it was time to share it with the world. \"...I told my employer that I have muscular dystrophy last year and it took a weight off my shoulder to be honest with my boss. I feel so relieved. My condition has progressed since then. I am regularly tired, need the use of a cane, still have issues walking and not getting tired and occasionally need a wheelchair. You don't know how it feels until it happens to you. I often feel like it controls my life....\" I posted it on my Tumblr page and shared the post on Facebook where all my friends, family and acquaintances would learn about the secret that I'd been holding onto for years. They read my post and supported me with tons of positive feedback and \"thank yous\" for finally sharing my experience. It felt warm. My family - my blood relatives and my Facebook family - continued to be a light and check on me as the symptoms progressed. It was really nice, but after a while I started to feel like they really didn't get it. They didn't know what it was like to fall constantly or not be certain if you can even move day by day. They didn't realize that I had to call ahead to go to the club at night, to ensure that they had a functioning elevator so that I could make my way up to groove to the music. I started reaching out to others in the disability community via social media and began cultivating a new sense of family. Others who \"got it\". It felt like I was finally understood and even better, that I was not alone. Now, five years later, I only know that I have LGMD. The doctors can't put their fingers on what subtype yet, but they know that at some point this thing could affect my heart. Echo-cardiogram tests are pretty regular for me, to let them know that my heart is still in working order. It's certainly scary but it has become \"my normal\". Living with LGMD is still new to me. Every day, I wake up not knowing how my legs are going to feel or if I'll feel them at all. I don't know what pain I'll have as I try to leave my apartment. I walk gingerly, hoping not to fall, afraid that I won't be able to pick myself back up. It's made me realize my internal strength despite the weakening of my limbs. I didn't think I would have so much strength to continue on after my diagnosis in my early twenties, but I somehow figured it out - and flipped it into a motivating organization. I had the power of resilience and positivity. If I didn't have it before, I developed a strong sense of empathy, really understanding that people everywhere struggle with things that the outside world cannot see. I was one of them. I look back and feel like I took things for granted: stealing bases on the softball field, running up and down the stairs with friends in high school, sewing my one-of-a-kind designs to strut around in and dress my models. But there's no way I could have known. My new normal doesn't include any of that. Instead, it includes a lot of time with my Personal Care Assistant (PCA) who helps me get in and out of bed, the shower and around town. It includes plenty of trips to the doctor and physical therapy. And sometimes, lots of stares from people wondering what a young millennial is doing walking around town with a limp and a cane. That's all okay. My new life is my life. I've accepted my new normal. I've regained my bubbly personality and have become a source of positivity and support for others in the disabled and diseased community through my organization and clothing line, Girls Chronically Rock. My smile has returned, knowing that I am still fulfilling my dreams. My path looks a little different than I envisioned but I am happy. I still hang out with friends at bars and restaurants and enjoy my favorite foods and reality TV. I have no problem belting out my favorite Beyonce songs. I am a business owner who loves the work that I do. I'm happy. I'm loved. I'm whole. I won't take where I've come for granted. Not one bit! There's no cure or pill that will fix it. My muscular dystrophy isn't going anywhere. It has its way of controlling some of my life, but it isn't who I am. I'm still Keisha Greaves: loving, creative daughter, sister and friend. I've even gained a few more titles: graduate, survivor, entrepreneur, speaker and advocate. This didn't take my life, it gave me purpose behind all that I do. Pressing on after my diagnosis is the hardest thing I've ever done, but I'm much stronger for doing it. My will and the support of my family keep me going. In a way, I guess that's how everyone is experiencing life right about now. As I'm writing this, no cure or vaccine for COVID has been created, and when I flip between the news stations, it seems that it isn't going anywhere anytime soon either. It does, similarly, have its way of controlling our lives - mandatory stay-at-home orders, masks and other protective equipment, forced distance between family and friends and then some. Post-pandemic, we'll all have gained some new talents, skills and titles - becoming a little bit more survivor and superhero. My advice is to allow it to give you purpose and set your true priorities into perspective. This might be the hardest thingwehave ever done, collectively, but how we support each other is what will keep us going. I want to remind you to never underestimate the power of your desire. If you want to do anything badly enough, you can. Everyday, I ask myself \"How do I decide I want to live?\" My PCA helps me from my bed, gets me ready for the day then I conquer it, with a smile. That's how I choose to live now, each and every day. Keisha Greaves is a business executive, fashion designer and activist and the founder ofGirls Chronically Rock.

    "data": "In 2005, at the age of 36, I was diagnosed withmesothelioma, an extremely rare form of cancer caused by asbestos. I developed the disease because as a little girl I used to wear my dad's coat - the same coat that he would wear to do construction with drywall and demolition work. Asbestos particles would travel back with him on his coat, and from there they got into my lungs. Most people who develop the disease die within 18 months. The really lucky ones make it five years. My story is almost unheard of, as earlier this year marked 10 years of being free of this deadly disease. The last 10 years have not been easy, but they have been a blessing despite hard times. One thing that has helped me get through it all is the work that I have done to spread awareness and educate the public about mesothelioma. I have also spent these last 10 years warning people about the dangers of asbestos, and trying to get the toxic substance banned here in the United States. It is really amazing how many opportunities have come my way because of mesothelioma, especially because, for most people, the disease means closing rather than opening doors. I've met so many wonderful people and been a part of so many incredible events. It seems hard to believe in light of my original diagnosis. In 2009, after I had attended a symposium run by theMesothelioma Applied Research Foundation- a nonprofit organization dedicated to finding a cure for mesothelioma cancer - I became aware of the annual observance of Mesothelioma Awareness Day, started by the Meso Foundation. The idea behind this event is to have a single day when mesothelioma patients, caregivers, advocates, doctors, researchers, and others can take out all the stops and let everyone know about the disease. That day is September 26th. But Mesothelioma Awareness Day is more than just any old awareness day. The Meso Foundation wanted to do something different. Every September 26th, supporters of the foundation-- Mesothelioma survivors, caregivers, individuals who have lost a loved one to the disease, union and industry workers exposed to asbestos--meet in New York City with the goals of coming together, learning together, and spreading awareness. On my first Mesothelioma Awareness Day, more than 50 of us met early in the morning outside of the Today show in Rockefeller Center. We wore the Meso Foundation's T-shirts, all with large, bold letters, and held signs telling the world why we were there. The Meso Foundation combined this awareness event with a one-day seminar on malignant mesothelioma. Since, my mom and I made have made this an annual tradition. Every year, we attend the events put on by the Meso Foundation, and also take advantage of all New York City has to offer. I love having my mom be a part of something so important to me. Every year is a reminder of how far I have come since my diagnosis. Over the past few years, I have decided to take in some other events to help bring awareness and raise money for mesothelioma research. For example, I have started participating in theMiles for Mesoevent, a fun 5k run or walk that has grown into multiple races held in several states. I am proud to be a participant again this year, and to be bringing my supportive husband Cam and my beautiful daughter Lily with me! This year, for the first time, I participated in the 6th annualKayaking 4 Mesoevent. Although I wasn't able to kayak myself, I, along with the other survivors, rode down the river in a pontoon! This event, started by my close friend Mark Wells whose daughter is a 15 year survivor of the disease and only 16 when she was diagnosed, (the average age of diagnosis is 60), was held on September 10th, before Mesothelioma Awareness Day, and raised money for the Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation. There was over 225 people kayaking down 8 miles of the Hudson River from Stillwater, NY, to Halfmoon, NY and there will be even more in attendance. Upon completion of the race, Mark was presented with the \"Above and Beyond\" award by Melinda Kotzian, the CEO Of the Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation. A much deserved honor for Mark who has raised well over $50,000 for the foundation. It was so great to finally be there to support him and be there when he received the award. All year long, I attend conferences and events and connect with patients, survivors, advocates, and others as much as possible. Back in the early years of my cancer survivorship, I even started my own observance on February 2nd that I call Lungleavin' Day, as it marks the anniversary of the day that I had one of my lungs removed - an operation that saved my life. It started out as a small get-together with a handful of family and friends, but has since grown into an event that approximately one hundred people attend. We all write our fears on plates and then smash them in the fire to show that those fears cannot conquer us! I know how lucky I am to have survived so long. I still sometimes struggle with strenuous activities, but this hasn't kept me from getting out there and doing all I can. Ten years ago, when I was having a lung taken out and getting chemotherapy and radiation, I never would have guessed that I would have so many opportunities to spread awareness about my disease in order to help others. I'm not writing all of this to pat my own back. I'm writing it in the hope that it will inspire others to get out there and spread some awareness of their own, about mesothelioma and the dangers of asbestos, or about some other rare disease or condition that has affected your own family. The important thing is just to get out there and make sure others know about it! You can learn more about Mesothelioma Awareness Dayhere.

    "data": "Segment 10 in our seriesSoul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill by Shaler McClure Wright You're listening to episode ten ofSoul Chronicles,offering a soulful perspective on how to navigate the unique challenges of living with ongoing health conditions. Special thanks to Health Story Collaborative for hosting this monthly audio column. My name is Shaler McClure Wright and I'm a writer/creative living with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. Story - When Doctors Are Among Us Sometimes I feel like my life has been shared more deeply with doctors than with friends. We entrust doctors with our medical histories, and that makes them a special kind of confidant. The doctor-patient relationship is rightfully protected by healthy boundaries, but when treatment spans the course of years, circumstances can arise that allow the relationship between a doctor and patient to deepen beyond the pages of a patient's chart. At first, I might see a doctor as an unapproachable god, or an exotic shamant, or even as a befuddled wizard hidden behind a suspiciously dark curtain. But over time, I've been gifted with a few unexpected moments that lift the veil of star-struck admiration and allow me to connect with a doctor soul to soul. I remember one such moment with my oncologist. She called me into her office to let me know I was ready to graduate from her care. But as she entered the exam room, intending to congratulate me on being ten years cancer-free, I couldn't help but notice she seemed very troubled. \"What's wrong?\" I asked. And after some reluctance, she replied, \"Robin Williams is dead.\" She had just heard the shocking news. The world had lost a great humanitarian. We broke into tears. Looking together, we whispered the words, \"Oh Captain! My Captain!\"; it was the best we could do to acknowledge the truth of his death without becoming overwhelmed. We were referring, of course, to Robin's inspiring role as English teacher John Keating in \"Dead Poets Society.\" It was a role close to his heart, and in that moment, memories of his performance softened our sorrow and made us smile. We spent the next thirty minutes exchanging his lines from the film. I began with my favorite, \"We didn't just read poetry; we let it drip from our tongues like honey.\" To which she replied, \"Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.\" That seemed like a perfect ending. She offered me a hug. We never talked about my breasts. There was no need; we had been talking about them for more than a decade. That was the last time I saw my oncologist. But from that day on I knew we had more in common than my diagnosis. Later that day I reminded myself of Walt Whitman's famous line in context. Here's the first couplet : \"O Captain! My Captain! our fearful trip is done, The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,\" This poem marks the end of a voyage, the end of a battle; just as my appointment marked the end of my journey with cancer and the end of Robin's life. Bittersweet as it was, Robin probably would've loved that. If you've known a doctor who embraces their practice with the depth of a poet, you've been blessed. But it's not unusual. In fact, the Journal of the American Medical Association has a regular section featuring practitioners' poetry, and it's edited by Dr. Rafael Campo. In an interview withHarvard Magazine, Campo explained, \"Poetry allows us to hear the beating of the heart. It allows us to immerse ourselves fully in another person's voice, and allows doctors to connect with patients on a more personal level.\" His belief is reflected in his poetry, as in this passage from his poem \"Cardiology\": \"They say the heart is just a muscle. Or the heart is where the human soul resides. I saw myself in you.\" Dr. Campo often speaks of healing and avoids the word 'cure.' \"When a cure isn't possible,\" he says, \"what do we still have to offer our patients? Our own humanity.\" A precious gift indeed. For those of us with ongoing health conditions, the psychological tension between seeking a cure and accepting our limitations can be strong. And doctors may be hard-pressed to find time to address this dilemma with humanity, but sometimes they find a way. The doctor who diagnosed my chronic illness is a molecular biologist and medical pioneer. His research is as close to artistry as science can get. Not only does he embrace medical mysteries, he embraces them with enthusiasm. The way he explores the structural elegance of biology along with its functional mysteries is an expression of beauty--I guess you could say I see him as a Soulful Scientist. My soulful scientist was the first doctor to give me tangible proof of my diagnosis, and he assured me that none of my symptoms was in my head. His belief in me and his careful, unhurried listening lifted me from the purgatory of disbelieving my own body. He also gave me confidence, and helped me learn to articulate the medical landscapes through which we passed. Recently my doctor let me know--very gently--that some of my discomforts would remain; they would improve with treatment, but they wouldn't go away. \"You might be at the point where you're trying to fix the unfixable,\" he suggested. My heart sank and I told him, \"The hardest part of being a patient is developing patience.\" He agreed and offered this story, \"The way I develop patience is through birdwatching. Last week, I saw a swarm of birds land on an impossibly small limb of a marshside tree. And I wondered how could so many fit, and how could such a small limb support their weight?\" At that moment I realized how I felt; exactly like those birds. How did he know that was the perfect image to offer me? I wanted to thank him for the compassionate way he delivered unwanted news, so after our meeting I added a caption to an image of birds crowded on a branch, and sent it to him. It said: \"When you're feeling alone and shaken, take a breath and remember, You're not the only one standing out on a limb.\" And to my surprise, he replied--by sharing a haiku he had written while out on the marsh that day. It said: Flocks of waxwings sweeping, Sheer dives end on twigs, Too small for so many birds. I had no idea he was a poet! With three little lines, I could imagine the dramatic effect of so many patients taking a sheer dive in health, and I could feel the insufficient support system that would bend under the weight of their crash landings. Twigs, too small for so many, too light to bear the impact. With that image in mind, I remembered I was not alone and that gave me more patience. But the haiku wasn't his only surprise. Doc and I had been meeting by phone (because he lives far away) and that limits one's body awareness. So he decided it was time to let me know, in simple, clear language, that I was not the only one out on that metaphorical limb. He revealed that he is unfixable too. He has Parkinson's Syndrome, and while it had been under control for a long time, he was experiencing his third relapse. Last month he was not well enough to travel to a medical conference where he was the keynote speaker. My first reaction was willful disbelief. How could a healer be in need of healing? How could this be? I needed more. So I asked, \"How did you learn to live with what you could not change? How did you move from patience to acceptance?\" In a way, I was asking him to offer me a serenity prayer for the medically unfixed. Patience. Acceptance. Courage. Wisdom. Four words to live by, but I needed a fifth; an actionable word. When I expressed my frustration, he laughed and said, \"I'm not sure if I told you, but thereisanother element tied to caring for the unknown...\" his voice sparkling at the opportunity to share his secret weapon--\"Doggedness. Churchill's 'never give up.'\" Yes, my soulful scientist had been demonstrating the healing power of dogged determination through the example of his own life--when one is limited in the physical sense, one can visualize instead. His honest admission of his struggle offered me encouragement that I too could adapt. And while his words were still fresh, I found myself wondering how often a physician's inner dialogue might be at odds with their professional vocabulary, and how frustrating that must feel. Rafael Campo describes the dichotomy between a physician's inner and outer thoughts, between what he is obliged to share and what he would prefer to share, in his poem \"What I Would Give.\" In the three stanzas I've selected, he expresses this contrast: \"What I would like to give them for a change is not the usual prescription with its hubris of the power to restore, to cure;\" [...] what I would like to offer them is this, not reassurance that their lungs sound fine, or that the mole they've noticed change is not a melanoma, but instead of fear transfigured by some doctorly advice I'd like to give them my astonishment at sudden rainfall like the whole world weeping, and how ridiculously gently it slicked down my hair; I'd like to give them that\" I love how he describes hubris as part of his challenge, while at the same time hinting that his job can often feel boring and routine. I love how he expresses that attempting to transfigure fear with medical advice can seem inadequate when compared to the transfiguring beauty of nature. In this poem we can feel the depth of his compassion. Once upon a time, healing could be conversational-- soulful as well as medical. But in today's world the opportunity for conversation is usually limited; although soulful doctors will still use their creativity to try. It's as if they remain mindful of another timeless line from \"Dead Poets Society\"--\"This is a battle, and the casualties could be your hearts and souls.\" Once we realize our greatest tool for connection is our humanity, we'd do well to remember one more line from the film. \"Medicine is a noble pursuit and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love--these are what we stay alive for.\" And we can help ourselves do this by honoring the five pillars of our 'unfixed' serenity prayer: patience, acceptance, courage, wisdom... and dogged determination. In a landscape of medical uncertainty, these are the words that will guide our soul. Link to Walt Whitman's full poem\"Oh Captain! My Captain!\" Link to Rafael Campo, MD's full poems \"Cardiology\" and\"What I Would Give\" And special thanks to Ritchie Shoemaker, MD, for sharing his haiku and humanity.

    "data": "Segment 12 in our seriesSoul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill by Shaler McClure Wright You're listening to episode twelve ofSoul Chronicles, offering a soulful perspective on how to navigate the unique challenges of living with ongoing health conditions. Special thanks to Health Story Collaborative for hosting this audio column. My name is Shaler McClure Wright and I live with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. Story - \"Changing the Way We Walk in the World\" Today I'd like to talk about the joy of walking. Putting one foot in front of the other. As in taking a stroll, jaunt, or constitutional. Walking is such a pleasant way to bookend a day. Yet in spite of the pleasure, sometimes we complain when we have to walk too far, or even worse, we may take for granted our ability to do so at all. And in my experience, once I start taking something for granted, it no longer gives me as much pleasure. Or perhaps I'd be more accurate to sayIgrow numb to the pleasure.And once numb, it can take a shock--like the loss of it--to remind me of how good I once felt. I've lost my ability to take a walk at two different times in my life. My first loss lasted almost a year, and the second spanned about seven weeks. Don't get me wrong, I could still get from point A to point B, but not without difficulty. The difference between the two lay in the difficulties of trying to walk with illness v.s. injury. And to highlight those differences, I'd like to tell you the story of how each episode affected me and offered me a unique lesson in how I see myself in relation to the world. One of my favorite habits is taking a daily walk to the sea. I live about a mile and a half from the ocean, and seven years ago, when I was in the throes of benzo withdrawal, that mile and a half felt like an impossibly long distance--because the path to the sea is rocky, with steep hills, and I was in pain. But I kept trying, even though I didn't get very far. One hot and humid day in August, I was sweating so much my glasses were foggy. Swarms ofno-see-umgnats were buzzing even louder than the ringing in my ears, and thanks to a lingering sense of vertigo, my world was spinning with every step. The hilly terrain made my heart race, and on that day, when the pounding got too intense, I stopped to rest at a stream. I seated myself on a smooth, warm rock rising above the surface of the water, and soaked my bare feet and ankles in its shade downstream. I was grateful for the moment of relief, but also discouraged. I could go no further. And while I sat, poised on my 'thinking stone', I felt my focus shift quietly to listening. The simple act of listening to running water reminded me that there is a flow to life, and we fare better when we try not to resist the current. But on that day I felt like I was tethered to stillness, and the best I could do was watch life flow by. I never made it to the ocean that day, and wondered if I ever would. Then, while still seated, I became aware of the warm sunlight inviting me to look up at the bright, cloud-painted sky, while my toes dug deep into the soft sediment of decomposing leaves, inviting me to enjoy the cool calm of the earth. And even though I was in a weakened physical state, I drew strength from feeling grounded, centered, and lifted by the beauty of the natural world. Because I was living with pain that was not visible to others, it was easy to feel overlooked. So being with nature was a welcome source of solace. I learned that day that even when my illness required absolute stillness, I could still be actively engaged with nature. A few days later, when I was feeling a bit better, I stopped along my path to the sea once again--this time to watch an adult Blue Heron take off from an inlet in the marsh. But instead of flying in a straight line from the inlet to the ocean, he took time to circle his little cove, not once, but three times--just as the Blue Angels might've flown in a formation of honor. I wonder if he was paying tribute to the thick beds of sea grass that had given him shelter and kept him safe? Right then I made a promise to myself to honor the beauty of my surroundings in the same way-- by taking time, and consciously acknowledging its existence. The ocean continued to wait for my arrival, and as my physical discomforts subsided, the hills became easier to climb. And as weeks became months and months became a year, I continued to take each uphill step with growing confidence and vigor. I remember the first time I made it to the top of the biggest hill--the last one, leading directly down to the sea--I could hear the waves rolling into shore before I could see them, and I could taste the salt on my face before I could smell it. And from that vantage point of height, I claimed victory; the ocean was even more compelling than I had remembered. I like to believe she felt my return; that my presence mattered. Looking back now, I can see that my daily walk served not only as exercise to increase my stamina, but also as a reminder that I am an integral part of the natural world. To illustrate what that sense of oneness might feel like, let me return to the words one of my favorite poets, Rainer Maria Rilke, in \"A Walk\", translated by Robert Bly: \"My eyes already touch the sunny hill. going far beyond the road I have begun, So we are grasped by what we cannot grasp; it has an inner light, even from a distance- and changes us, even if we do not reach it, into something else, which, hardly sensing it, we already are; a gesture waves us on answering our own wave... but what we feel is the wind in our faces.\" To have felt the inner light of the natural world is to have felt a soulful connection. And to have been changed by it, even without understanding it, is a soulful act. Because of my walks during that time of impairment, I learned to recognize my relationship with nature as unconditional. It was as if Mother Nature could sense my invisible pain and instead of retreating, or avoiding, she welcomed me. Now let's look at the second time I I lost my ability to walk freely... Once I was able to resume my daily walk to the sea, and for the next seven years, I continued to grow stronger. I still had another chronic health condition, but it didn't limit my mobility in the same way benzo withdrawal had. But I also began to take walking for granted again.Yep, I guess I'm one of those people who needs to be taught a lesson more than once before itsinks in. And just last October, I was offered that chance. I traveled to Cannon Beach, Oregon with a dual purpose--one, to spend quality time with my brother; and two, to escape my newly empty nest back home. My only child had just started college in September, and I needed to rediscover myself as someone other than his mom. Since walking had always been therapeutic for me, a trip to Cannon Beach sounded ideal. The Oregon coast is so dramatic, it seemed like a perfect place for soulful reflection. Indeed, with a sky darkened by flocks of pelicans, and the towering landmark Haystack Rock--dotted with nesting puffins and reeking of fresh guano--I felt I had stepped into a world where nature was more dominant than humans. I was walking barefoot on the cool, firm sand with my brother and his two large dogs, when I failed to notice the Great Pyrenees stopped abruptly right in front of me. Instead I had been looking up, admiring the looming presence of Haystack, and in my moment of distraction, stubbed my foot against his motionless hind leg. After making sure I hadn't hurt him, I noticed my baby toe was sticking out at a strange angle and felt a warm pain spreading across the top of my left foot. Soon it turned eggplant-purple. Turned out I had fractured a toe and metatarsal, and I was surprised by how much that encumbered me. Those tiny broken bones meant thatonce again, I would temporarily lose my ability to walk with ease. This time, not due to an invisible illness, but due to a visible physical injury that included a cumbersome orthopedic boot. I never could've anticipated that due to this injury, my journey's purpose ofrediscovering myselfwould now be weighted down by a clunky, white stormtrooper boot--limiting my movement to a slow shuffle, along with a limp and an aching lower back. That boot became the center of my world and literally changed the way I walked in it. Because of the boot, I had to walk slowly and move with care. It was a visible impediment and caused me to stand out. You might even say that boot became a symbol of my physical limitation around which others could gather. Because that's exactly what happened. For the first time in my life, the pain and discomfort I was experiencing was easy to see. Friends and family could relate, and went out of their way to be helpful, show their concern and offer sympathy. I feltseen, and appreciative of their support. And then, to my surprise, I began to feel aresentmentgrowing inside me. Resentment for years of loneliness while living with ongoing episodes of yet another invisible illness; one that until recently, I hadn't even been able to name. It was an ugly feeling--resentment--but since it had reared its head, I decided to pay attention. And when I did, I came to realize thatIhad played a part in my loneliness too. I had not made enough effort to help others understand how I felt. I had not invited them to cross the threshold to my invisible world. And just as I hadn't realized how much walking meant to me untilI couldn't walk, so too I hadn't realized how much feeling seen by others meant to me. In fact, I hadn't even recognized that I feltunseen, until I felt its return. My son had always been more aware of my ongoing health challenges than others because he and I spent the most time together. Now that he had gone off to college, I became aware of how much health information I had held back from others. And I wondered, \"How can I feel such resentment when I've made no effort to be honest about my pain?\" And then, looking down at my clunky white boot for the hundredth time that day, I realized I wanted to learn how to share my feelings more honestly, especially my feelings about living with illness. Then, with the boot symbolically keeping my attention focused on my feet, I suddenly had akickerof an insight: After I'd kicked myself out of my empty nest, and then accidentally kicked the hind leg of a giant dog, I was left to find out the most important kick of all would be the kick I needed to give myself in the proverbial ass. I discoveredI needed to be more open with others if I wanted to feel more visible to others. It's safe to say that if I hadn't lost my son as a live-in confidant, or if I'd been without the inconvenience and limitations of visible injury, it would not have been possible for me to recognize that my perception of being invisibly ill was at leastpartiallyof my own making. In addition to learning I never wanted to take walking for granted again, I also learned that I need to be my own best advocate. Any one of us can change the way we walk in the world. And when we do, it can change the way others perceive us. But it's up to us to make ourselves visible and muster the courage to make that choice. I'd like to leave you with one final image that just came to me today, while once again walking my daily path to the sea. I was taking a break from writing this chronicle and stopped at my special stream. And as is often the case, the water was patiently holding a message for me: There were five little bubbles circling around a shallow pool on the water's edge, but none of them was big enough to break free from the swirling centrifugal force of the pool and return to the flowing stream. It wasn't until they merged together, until five bubbles became one, that they gathered enough energy to move forward again. When the bubbles were separate, they were stuck. When they came together, they could move again. Such is the power of opening ourselves to others. For those of you living with pain that is hard to see, I hope this story leaves you feeling less alone. Becoming more visible is a process, and it's not always easy. But perhaps that's to remind us--not to take it for granted. Goherefor more episodes of our Soul Chronicles series.

    "data": "By Max Merget That one moment, that one event that will change who you are started when I was three but never came to mind until I was 17 years old. My name is Max and I have been a brain cancer patient since I was a toddler. People always ask, \"How did you know you had a brain tumor and what was it like?\" The answer is simple if you have seen it first-hand. My family and some friends were enjoying a weekend in Canada at our cottage. I was only a little boy when my right leg started to drag on the ground. My right arm and hand clenched up, making it look as if I was some dinosaur with a short and useless arm. My speech patterns started to get distorted, making it hard for my parents to understand me. That is when you know you are having brain issues. My Mom scheduled an appointment with our family doctor that Monday. My pediatrician knew something was wrong and recommended we get to the University of Michigan's Mott Children's Hospital for further testing. Doctors there ran tests and an MRI of my brain, which exposed a massive cancerous brain tumor. The doctors were shocked when they looked at my images. They were confused to see my minor imperfections considering that my cancer took up two thirds of my head. Surgery was performed the next day. All of this was just the beginning play in the cards that I was dealt. My cancer came back at age four and again at seven. Throughout my life, I've had brain surgery three times, radiation therapy twice, and chemotherapy once. I do not have much memory from the early years of my life. I've had so many horrific experiences in my first 10 years of life that my brain decided to block them out. My only memories of my childhood comes from pictures, home videos, and the stories my parents tell me every once and a while. The memories come across with two perspectives. I look to first understand what happened to me. I can't help myself to then understand my parents' decisions and sacrifices they had to make. It was the beginning of my senior year of high school and life was treating me well. I was doing well in school and got accepted to Grand Valley State University. My 10-year mile marker for being cancer free was coming up that year. I was told after 10 years of being cancer free, the chances of the cancer returning were slim. Every year, I would go in for MRI brain scans and for checkups. I always felt that the MRIs were pointless as I was feeling great, ready to conquer the world.I had cancer when I was a child and now I am in remission, was my thought. But then I was called in for an off-schedule MRI. Apparently, there was some scar tissue that my neurosurgeon saw and just to make sure, they wanted another scan. You go in for the scan and then you come back the next day and meet with the doctors to review the scans. The day to review the scans was my 10-year mile marker anniversary. I will never forget this day. My appointment was at 11 am. My parents and I knew something was up, but I was staying optimistic. The car ride to Mott Hospital was quiet with some unanswered questions that would be answered soon enough. It was if I was driving only to get bad news.If my cancer came back, would I have to have brain surgery for a fourth time? How far would my treatment set me back?Sitting in the waiting room was never so painful and I was very eager for the nurse to call my name. Finally, she did, and I hopped out of my seat. My neurosurgeon has spina bifida and uses a Segway. It is a little hard for her to get around and we are usually in the office before she arrives, except for this appointment. I was the first to walk in with my mom and dad following. The meeting room was small with a sanitary smell. I was being quiet while my parents made small talk with my neurosurgeon and my oncologist. I was standing in the back by an open chair waiting for the news. My neurosurgeon spun around in her own chair and looked right at me. With a very powerful and determined voice she said, \"Max, It's back. Your brain cancer is back.\" I dropped my jaw and fell into the chair as if my legs fell out from under me. Thoughts rushed through my mind quickly without any resolve. Having the idea that I'd never have to go through this again and all the time I had put into functioning normally had just been an illusion. I learned that my cancer is very rare and that it can come back whenever it wants to. When I was three, I was one out of thirteen people in the country to be diagnosed. Also, my cancer is normally found in the spine. For some reason, mine is located in the frontal lobe of my brain. This was the first time that I actually knew what I had to undertake. Throughout the years, my parents never brought up this topic. It was difficult to handle my emotions and to keep my composure. As I was sitting in the back thinking about my life and how it was going to change, my neurosurgeon was going through my different options of removing the cancer. I had three options to choose from: surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Ultimately I was going to side with whatever my neurosurgeon thought. She has been with me since I was three and I trust every decision she makes. For 10 years of my life, I had the privilege to walk out of that hospital with a smile on my face. Now I was leaving with more questions than I had coming in. Words cannot explain the feeling of having an alien-like substance just eating away at your brain. The car ride home was extremely silent. All of the memories and emotions of my childhood came rushing through my parents' minds. I could see from the back seat a single tear run down my mom's face. Seeing that one tear only emphasized the hardship that I was yet again going to live through. Once I got back home, I went upstairs to my room and slammed the door in anger that my cancer was out of my hands to control. I had to accept my situation and get back to living my life. I took a shower, then regrouped so I could continue my day. I even went to work washing dishes at a pizza place. Going back to your normal life is the best mental treatment. After a long seven-hour shift, I walked out to my car to leave when I noticed a lot of notifications on my phone. The word got out through my parents telling their friends about my news. I was trending on Twitter and everyone in my world had contacted me via Facebook, email, text, and calls. Then it came to me,maxyourbrian.org. I started my own foundation for cancer research. I would have fundraiser events to educate the public about what cancer patients have to go through and the importance of funding the research done at Michigan Medicine. The funds supported the research time in the labs and paid for equipment. I raised $43,000 to fund my neurosurgeon's research. My cancer will never succeed in bringing me down, but it will always be a part of my life. Once someone asked me, \"what would life be like without cancer?\" I had to think about it for a minute and I simply replied, \"I don't know who I'd be without cancer, but I love who I am with it.\" About the Author We are not here to live, but to thrive. Max Merget finds himself to be very fortunate to have been able to bounce back and survive brain cancer for the fifth reoccurrence. The MYB team will help raise awareness and money so that brain cancer patients can have a healthier life.",

    "data": "Segment 1 of 6 in ourSoul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill series. by Shaler Wright Audio Transcript: My name is Shaler Wright. I'm 63 years old and I have Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. I've had it for many years, but until this year, I didn't know there was a name for it. It's not active all the time, so, for decades really, I've resented my body and felt like it was failing me when I had symptoms, But what if the truth was actually the opposite? What if, against all odds, my body had been fighting a magnificent battle, and was a strong warrior, deserving acknowledgment and celebration? Imagine how it might affect our healing if we were to give our bodies the admiration they deserve... When an illness becomes debilitating, it's a crisis. But what if we can remain open? If we can keep an open mind, then chronic iIlness can actually become cathartic, and our healing can include a reunification of our heart, mind, body and soul. What does it take to make that shift? To make that shift in our attitude toward our body to get it from enemy to ally? We need to see our symptoms through a new lens. What if we can learn to see our symptoms as an awakening, as an opportunity? That would change everything. James Hillman is a Jungian psychologist and he had this to say about symptoms: \"The right reaction to a symptom may as well be welcoming rather than laments and demands for remedies, for the symptom is the first herald of an awakening psyche that will not tolerate any more abuse.\" Wow, what a way to turn it around. But how do we do that? Well, I think we need to stop trying to package our symptoms in a neat little box. We need to see them as part of a bigger experience. As a clue, for parts of ourselves that need attention. Like lost sheep, needing to be brought back into the fold. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking \"Why would I want to pay attention to something that hurts or is uncomfortable? Why would I want to focus on it? I just want to make it go away!\" I totally understand that because I think that's what all of us with chronic conditions do. We teach ourselves to distract, I think that's the first thing. We teach ourselves to distract ourselves from any unpleasant feeling. We just ignore it. We try to keep busy with other things, and eventually this leads to dissociation. Eventually our minds are not even connected to our bodies any more. We get really good at it. We get really good at doubting whether anything is actually real. When we feel pain we say, \"Oh that's not real. I'm just exaggerating in my head. That's not anything.\" But it is. And we know it deep inside. And sometimes we even go so far as to feel shame. We feel shame that we feel that way. We feel like our body is failing us. And we alienate ourselves from ourselves. This self alienation is absolutely crippling. But I think it's a habit almost all of us have. And habits are hard to break. Sometimes it takes an outside influence to help us make the change. For me, that influence was a new doctor. After I rattled off my litany of seemingly disconnected complaints, instead of looking dazed and like he didn't believe me (like other doctors had), he took a long pause and he said, \"We're gonna figure this out.\" And poof! Just like that, I had a partner. I was validated. I felt legitimate. And it felt great. Our journey together would take years. Two steps forward, one step back. But it was OK. It was OK. For the first time I felt like I was on a path instead of stuck in a hole. And, looking back, I think I needed that time to learn how to reconnect with the body I had abandoned. I need to learn to sit quietly, and pay attention. To visualize my pain without dismissing it. I learned to respect my symptoms, and to learn that they were, in fact, trying to teach me, not hurt me. It can feel very humbling to admit to ourselves that we're not in touch with our own body. It seems like such a natural thing to be able to do, and yet so elusive for those of us who have learned to ignore our discomforts. But once we take that first step, the next ones become easier. My first step came with pregnancy. My illness makes it difficult to become pregnant because it messes with my hormones. So I had given up hope of ever having a child. Then at age 45, I found out I was pregnant. Not only was I pregnant, I was NINE weeks pregnant and I didn't know it. I had lost-I had had several miscarriages-before that and just assumed that would continue to happen. But this was nine weeks. It was nine weeks, it was enough to count! I was pregnant! And when I got over the shock of actually being pregnant I realized that I couldn't feel it. I couldn't feel my child growing inside of me. And that scared me. So I went to an energy healer for guidance. I wanted her to keep my child safe. I wanted her to reassure me that he - yes I knew it was a he - that he would be growing in safety. She told me that he had a very strong presence. He had a strong, warm, bright light. And that he would most likely be a peacemaker, a builder of bridges. And I thought, \"What a gift. What a gift that I get to bring this child into the world!\" And then I got sick. My symptoms started acting up and I got bronchitis. And coughing like crazy. They had to give me codeine so I wouldn't cough so much and that's kind of a tricky thing when you're pregnant. I also got in a car accident and broke a rib, and I was terrified I was going to lose my child. My ObGyn told me that my son probably saved my life. That thanks to him, I was like a big bubble-wrapped UPS package, and I just bounced off any harm from the impact. So my unborn child and I were partners. Not only in adversity, but also partners in change. Because pregnancy is all about change, constant change. And my pregnancy taught me not to fear change. For the first time, I felt discomfort as progress, and I knew it would be temporary. I used to fear any changes in my body because change could be triggering. I feared an unavoidable cascade in symptoms. But you know, you know the old saying 'the only way out is through?' Well, that's true for positive change as well. If you never chance for fear of losing, you've already lost. So change became my friend and my ally. I often return to a quote from Marcus Aurelius's \"Meditations.\" \"Time is a sort of river of passing events, and strong is its current; no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place, and this too will be swept away.\" The first time I read this I thought it was distressing. \"Such impermanence! Can we count on nothing?\" Hmm. Yes, we can count on change. And that's a good thing. That's progress. And the changes needed to switch our chronic illness from a crisis to a catharsis are primarily changes in attitude. We need to trust our growing awareness of our body, and listen to it. And pause when a treatment is not working, instead of just being compliant because we're ashamed and feel like we have no right to even be there. Chronic illness can be a lonely road. We need to ask for fellow travelers. We may feel odd and unknowable but others know that feeling too. And if we can let down our guard and allow ourselves to be seen, we will find out we're not alone. We're not odd, we're just challenged. Our bodies are challenged. And as soon as we can stop resenting our bodies for being challenged, then we can begin to appreciate the unfathomable resilience of our bodies. And even if we never come to understand all the whys and hows of everything that happens to our bodies, we can cherish the fact that mystery, as well as change, is one of our body's greatest gifts.",

    "data": "Putting the pieces of pain together can't be done by just asking, \"Where does it hurt?\" I have always been somewhat accident-prone. Each time I tripped and fell as a child brought the same routine. I would sit on the edge of the tub in my parents' bathroom with a bleeding knee and a tear-streaked face as my mom or dad got out the Band-Aids, Neosporin, and the despised hydrogen peroxide (it stung too much when it fizzed). I would point to the scrape and roll up my sleeve to reveal any other \"boo-boos.\" I would leave their bathroom with my lacerations clean, my face dry of tears, and feeling okay, albeit a little achy. Nearly fifteen later, as a sophomore in college, I shadowed Dr. X every Wednesday afternoon for the practicum component of a semester-long course on Medical Professionalism. In Dr. X's office, many patients would come in with a laundry list of pain, soreness, discomfort, and hurt. The question \"Where does it hurt?\" seemed insufficient to understanding their pain fully. The patient may have struggled to push back on Dr. X's hand with their face. They sometimes found it difficult to answer inquiries such as, \"When did the pain start?\" or, \"Is it radiating?\" All of these are pieces of the understanding required to provide adequate and appropriate treatment. Doing so demands the asking the patient multiple pointed questions while also testing them physically. This understanding appeared to be elusive and difficult to acquire for three main reasons: time, creativity, and trust. Time During my Wednesdays with Dr. X, I often noticed a tension between the care patients want and the realities of care in our current healthcare system. Patients would often try to show her pictures of their grandchildren or a recent vacation. Sometimes, they, an aging parent, wanted her to explain over the phone what was wrong with them to a concerned child who could not make the appointment. She always obliged as best she could but the system in which she provided care made it difficult. Dr. X was known in her practice for seeing roughly half as many patients as her fellow physicians. She often mentioned to me how difficult it was to accommodate these seemingly irrelevant components of a patient visit when they were often what made the patient most comfortable and most inclined to tell their story. The doctor's visit with the patient can only last so long, for other patients need care too, and there are only so many hours in the day. Thus, even when the \"right\" questions are being asked, patients may not have the opportunity to fully translate their feelings, aches, and pains into words with context (a mosaic of experiences, emotions, environment, and everything in between). As a result, it is challenging to gain a strong understanding of what they are experiencing and subsequently make a suggestion about how to treat their condition(s). Creativity I often noted Dr. X's inventiveness on our Wednesdays together, inspired by her ability to ask questions that led her closer to a diagnostic truth regarding the patient's experiences. Sometimes people are insecure about their diets, how much they exercise, how often they take a prescribed medicine, and other areas of their lives in which they are not perfectly compliant with doctors' orders. Thus, we are less likely to offer responses to a provider's question that allow them to help us, for we are trying to protect ourselves without even realizing it. This reminds me of visits to the dentist. When the hygienist asks if I've been flossing as she scrapes and polishes my teeth, I know that I have to be honest because she has the proof right in front of her. But we all often lie, feeling sheepish for not doing what was asked of us. Sometimes a matter-of-fact question like, \"Do you go to the gym regularly?\" is sufficient for a useful answer that guides the doctor to a diagnosis. However, sometimes it seems more appropriate and productive to ask, \"What is your daily schedule?\" This gives the patient a chance to tell the doctor what they want, be it that the entirety of their exercise regimen consists of walking to work, or that they stop at Chick-fil-A on their way home for dinner. Although this question may not have appeared at the start to have a direct correlation with healthy eating/regular exercise, it may make the patient more comfortable and allow for a more organic conversation. When Doctor X asks more flexible and open questions, this allows for more creative and varied responses that are generally more constructive toward devising a care plan. Trust Meeting a patient where they are in a non-judging, kind, and sensible manner, they are much more likely to open up and let the provider know what hurts and how they feel. I trusted my parents to clean my wounds after a fall off my bike and bandage me all up, pointing them to the areas in need of a little love. Similarly, I observed Dr. X's patients explain pain \"at a level eight\" that keeps them up at night with a trust that she will take their words and turn them into a diagnosis and treatment that gives them relief. --- Although all patients are different, everyone expects individualized care from their doctor and are usually hoping to be healed. Time, creativity, and trust are crucial pillars that support how the provider meets their patient's needs by putting their symptomatic puzzle together into a diagnosis. When I was a little girl, I expected my parents to take my skinned knee and clean it up so that I was good as new. With Dr. X's patients, their complicated aches and pains require more than just a Band-Aid, but she does have the power to offer them solace. I hope one day to be able to provide antidotes for my patients' pain, and will strive to ask questions that allow me to do so.

    "data": "By John Miller, MD I feel very fortunate. I am staying one step ahead of viral transmission. With my career in transition, I have worked in three settings over the past three months. I volunteered in Zambia for three months at a rural clinic near South Luangwa National Park. The infection had started to spread from China by the time I left, but there was hardly an inkling of what was to come at that point. Two months after my departure, Zambia shut down and many of the expatriate workers returned home. The clinic where I worked had very limited testing capabilities (Hgb, glucose, urinalysis, malaria, HIV, and a send out test for TB). They make do working with limited information. They also trust authority and abide by the government, both of which will help control viral transmission. For a country dependent on tourism and foreign aid, how long until things get back to normal? A month ago, I was working in the urgent care in Zuni, New Mexico. It was very busy with a lot of patients with cold and flu symptoms. The hospital had started separating sick from well and asking patients with symptoms to wear masks. I remember feeling thankful for that. I saw a patient with cough and body aches who I would have liked to test for COVID-19. He had recently traveled to Oklahoma to California and back trading feathers, but did not have an adequate fever for us to get one of the limited tests from the state lab. The first three positive test results in New Mexico came the day after we left. Several cases in the area then came out of a church revival in the Pinehill area on the Navajo reservation near Zuni. The risks of infection are much higher on reservations than in other parts of the country. There is a huge burden of chronic disease as well as chronic underfunding and staffing shortages in the Indian Health Services. In addition, households are multigenerational and extended families are inter-reliant to meet basic needs. Despite this and having positive tests among Zuni tribal members, religious leaders controversially decided to hold their traditional night dances last weekend before imposing a curfew two weeks after the statewide stay at home order by New Mexico's governor. Zuni's first death from COVID-19 was reported today. How many cases and deaths in Zuni will there be in a week? I am now working in the ED on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Browning, Montana. There are no known cases on this reservation, and we have been testing. There was a nursing home outbreak that led to three deaths in a neighboring county to the east, but now there are no new cases in three days. To the west, a more populous county continues to have new cases. I read that the statewide stay at home order is seen by some as an infringement of their constitutional rights. Should church services and the right to assemble for any reason be considered essential? \"Will our country ever be the same?\" I was a bit slow to accept the need for social and physical distancing. Our spring break ski road trip with another family was only cut short when all of the resorts closed. As I write this though, I am on a break in the ED, wearing mask and goggles as I do at all times. With no COVID-19 cases and the hospital encouraging people to stay away, the ED has been slow. Most of the ED cases have been patients who need emergent evaluation. It has been nice. It leaves time to reflect and try to prepare for what is coming.I know it is coming, even to one of the most remote counties in the country. I am told that there is a flow of methamphetamines from Seattle to Spokane to Browning. It seems like just a matter of time. I am healthy, adaptable and flexible so know I will get through this. As an introvert, I am actually enjoying the additional time to myself and with my family. That part has been really great.I am challenged, though, to accept those who denied this was coming, and who are still denying it. Even more disturbing are those who know it is coming but still want to assemble, to grandstand shouting \"Give me liberty or give me death!\" through some grandiose view of themselves and their struggles. This is not the revolutionary war. It's not except for a small number of anti-government folks who are actually not that far from main stream in the mountain west. This comes up from time to time, living on a blue island in a sea of red. That is Missoula in western Montana. One former physician colleague is still comparing the number of flu deaths last year to the number of COVID-19 deaths. He is not alone in these parts, and they get to have it both ways. Oppose the current mitigation as unnecessary and then tout the results of it as evidence that denial was justified all along. They might say it is just their \"personal, educated opinion\" but it seems their concern for their beleaguered President's reelection chances exceed their concern for the health of their neighbors and patients. I guess it shouldn't bother me so much, but I guess I expect more, at least at a time like this. Can't we all just put politics aside? \"Will our country ever be the same again?\" We can only hope that some things change. John Miller, MD is a family medicine doctor in Missoula, MT.

    "data": "Years ago I had a positive experience with a remarkable Nurse Practitioner at UCLA named Sherry Goldman who was in charge of a special program for breast cancer, a disease of which I had. I was struggling with the terrible side effects of my treatments. They were getting the best of my mind, and my body. When I walked into her office for my appointment, she did the physical examination but she also asked me how I was feeling and remarkably she waited for the answer. I was open and honest with every detail. She validated my feelings and made me feel less alone with my thoughts. Her medical suggestion to improve my status was to take walks every day. \"Start small, short distances, a block or two and then make it longer with each day\", she suggested. My response to her was a resounding \"NO! I don't want to. I don't feel well, I don't look good, and I don't have the energy.\" Well, the Nurse Practitioner sat quietly for a moment, absorbing my adamant stance and then said to me those magic words, the words that only one could say if they had taken the time to really listen, while having the keen observational skills to sense what the problem was with a simple walk. What were her words? I know you're waiting for them. Her words were, \" Then don't walk for you Marla, walk for ME... and I want to hear how much you've walked when you come back to see me in two weeks.\" Suddenly my eyes lit up, my back straightened and a fire was in my belly and it wasn't acid indigestion. That day I went home and started to walk and with each day I walked more and more, longer and further. Soon, I was walking for hours daily, chomping at the bit to report back to Sherry with pride at my accomplishment. Two weeks later I did just that at my next appointment at UCLA, when I saw her. I looked like a new person, and I was. There is a belief that one shouldn't do things just to please someone else but rather to do it to please oneself. Well, that is all well and good some of the time but there are other times when it's imperative to break that rule. If pleasing someone else is the key to getting a person back on track and healthy again then so be it and that's exactly what happened with me. Not only did my health and strength improve, but I also took up jogging and now I walk and run FOR ME! and I have not stopped since. I'm entering my first 5K Marathon in March. I have not had that kind of positive experience with the medical profession since, but I will NEVER forget what that incredibly smart and talented Nurse Practitioner did for me. NEVER!",

    "data": "By Chris Anselmo Author's Note: Please share this piece with anyone who might benefit from reading it. If there's anything I've learned, it's that we all struggle to ask for help. The paramedic relayed my condition to the medical team waiting inside the ER lobby. \"This is Chris Anselmo. 27 years old. Has a disease called limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. His symptoms are chest pain and shortness of breath. He thinks he might be having a heart attack.\" I drew in air through my oxygen mask, but the crushing pressure on my chest kept my lungs from fully expanding. Doctors and nurses wheeled me into an empty room off the main corridor. A flurry of blue arms sprung into action. One nurse removed my sweat-soaked t-shirt. Another placed EKG electrodes on my bare chest. A third drew blood from my right arm. \"We'll be right back,\" said one of the nurses in a thick Boston accent. \"Press the button if you need us. We'll know the results soon. You're gonna be okay, hon.\" I didn't believe her, but then again, I had never been rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night before. I tried another deep breath. Another struggle. Alone in my thoughts, all I could do now was wait. I closed my eyes and replayed the past hour in excruciating detail: Waking up at 3 am gasping for air, drenched in sweat even though my air conditioner was running at full blast. Dialing 911 and talking to the dispatcher, my hands shaking violently as I gripped the phone. Digging dirty clothes out of the hamper, a wardrobe born of convenience and desperation. Knocking over my forearm crutches in a futile attempt to grab both handles with one hand. Riding in the ambulance through the pitch-black streets of Cambridge, Massachusetts wondering if this was the end, and if so, who would call my parents. A knock on the door broke me out of my trance. The ER doctor -- a short middle-aged man in a white lab coat -- walked in, followed by the nurse with the Boston accent. The doctor held a clipboard with a printout of my results. \"Good news. You didn't have a heart attack. This was definitely a panic attack.\" Thank God.The pressure on my chest lifted, and for the first time in an hour, I drew in a deep breath. Sweet, crisp air filled every inch of my lungs. \"I'm so glad it's not....wait, a panic attack?\" I sat up. \"But I've had those before. This felt much more intense. Much worse.\" The doctor looked up from his clipboard. \"Panic attacks can vary. Some are severe enough, like tonight, to land you in the ER. Have you been stressed more than usual recently?\" \"Yes.\" \"Any particular reason?\" I hesitated. In the past, when someone asked about my emotional state, I always answered in two words: \"I'm fine.\" But this time, that wouldn't be enough. He needed more. \"It's...\" My voice trailed off. I knew what I was feeling, but didn't know how to put it into words.Damn, why was this so hard?Exasperated,I pointed to the crutches leaning on the chair next to my bed. The doctor nodded. \"Understandable. But a panic attack this bad is usually the result of accumulated stress and anxiety over a long period. Do you talk to anyone about your struggles?\" \"Not really.\" \"Okay, well we're going to have to change that. Talk to a therapist, or a close family member or friend, or a trusted mentor. You need to get help, because this can happen again.\" I leaned my head back against the pillow. Although I was glad I wasn't about to die, I felt humiliated. How did I let it get to this point? Why couldn't I let people know I was having a hard time? The doctor was right. My ER trip was a long time coming, the result of years of saying \"I'm fine,\" when in reality, I was anythingbutfine. Growing up, when I experienced stress or sadness, my default was to hide it from the world. When my parents asked how I was doing, rather than say I was overwhelmed by classwork, or that I didn't have a lot of friends, I shrugged. \"I'm fine.\" To this day, I'm not sure when or how this response became my answer to emotional inquiries. My parents and older sister, Jen, always showered me with love, so it wasn't a matter of fearing rejection. Perhaps it was simply due to my introverted nature, or being a teenager who didn't yet understand the full spectrum of emotions inherent to the human condition. Instead of confronting my negative emotions head-on, it was easier to ignore them or change the topic. And, for a long time, this approach worked. From childhood through college, I was able to bottle up my struggles without long-term repercussions. Sure, I'd have periodic bouts of depression or weeks when I was stressed out by a looming exam, but I always navigated through rough patches without needing to talk to anyone. I just figured this is how life works. But self-sufficiency only lasted so long. When I first noticed muscle weakness six weeks after graduating college in 2008 -- the onset of a rare disease called limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B -- I did what I had always done whenever I encountered adversity: I told no one. Eventually, I had to let my family and friends know that I was getting weaker. (My parents knew about the disease from when I was diagnosed after a car accident in 2004; but at the time, we were told symptoms would manifest later in life.) The disease was becoming impossible to conceal; it turns out that struggling to climb stairs sets off alarm bells in peoples' minds. Everyone was concerned by my physical decline and wanted to help in any way possible. My parents offered to make the trip from Connecticut to Boston every two weeks to help me grocery shop and cook meals. My roommates volunteered to do my laundry so I wouldn't have to trek up and down three flights of stairs. Jen, who lived in North Carolina, invited me to visit her any time I needed to escape Boston. My family and friends made my life much easier, chipping in whenever I needed assistance. I am forever grateful for how they stepped up to the plate in those early days. But they were only aware of thephysicalsymptoms. My emotional turmoil was a different story. They didn't know it was eating me up inside that I could no longer shoot a basketball. They didn't know about the piercing stares I received anytime I got on an elevator to go up one floor. They didn't know about the corrosive envy I felt as I watched my friends achieve all the life milestones I wanted for myself -- falling in love, having kids, buying homes in the suburbs. They didn't know about the self-loathing for who I had become, how instead of facing my challenges head-on, I withered under the pressure. They didn't know about the panic attacks that occurred any time I contemplated the future. They didn't knowany of it --and yet, I wanted them to know. I wanted to offload my burden onto someone who cared. But years of shrugging and deflecting had come back to haunt me. I lacked the experience to lay bare my emotions and let people know what was going on. \"What's wrong, Chris?\" my mom asked when my parents came to visit three weeks before my trip to the ER. \"You've been so quiet. Is everything okay?\" \"I'm fine.\" My mom could tell I was lying. \"Did something happen? Did you fall? Are you in pain?\" I wanted this to be the moment. I was ready to tell my parents that I was struggling. I knew they wanted to help. The words wereinchesfrom spilling out. I'm overwhelmed. This disease has taken over my life. I hate how I'm handling it. I hate that I've equated my self-worth to how strong I am. I'm envious of my friends advancing in their lives and careers. I'm tired of seeing people enjoying themselves. I resent everyone's success. I'm mad at the world. I'm scared of the future. \"I'm fine. Just tired, that's all.\" If only I had known the relief waiting for me on the other side. I was released from the hospital at daybreak, my path forward as clear as the orange sunrise sneaking up behind the Boston skyline. I needed to change. I had to find a way to push through the discomfort, to open up and ask for help, whether to a therapist, friends, or my parents. To someone,anyone. \"I'm fine\" wasn't going to cut it anymore. When I returned to my apartment, I collapsed on my bed, still donning the dirty t-shirt and sweatpants dug out from the hamper three hours prior. Although exhausted, my mind raced. I had to find the root cause of why my mind and body melted down so suddenly. So severely. In retrospect, my previous panic attacks were warning signs, internal pleas to reverse course and seek help before I tumbled into the abyss. Warnings that I ignored. The disease shared some of the blame, but, deep down, I knew it was just fanning the flames of an existing fire. Years of suppressing my feelings and avoiding uncomfortable conversations pre-dated my muscle weakness. Over the next few days, I sought out the source of my hesitation. If I could better understand why I struggled to open up, then I might feel more comfortable reaching out to someone. What choice did I have? One trip to the hospital was enough. After days of soul-searching, my self-examination identified three barriers that kept me from asking for help:pride,fear,andshame: Pride- I took pride in being self-sufficient. Before my disease, I thrived as a young adult. I did well in school, had many close friends, and loved living in Boston. Then the symptoms started, and it made clear just how much I could accomplish on my own. By needing help, I felt like a failure. Fear- I didn't want my family to worry about my health more than they already did. I was also afraid that, by sharing my struggles, people would think less of me. Shame- I was ashamed....of everything. I was ashamed I was so insecure. I was ashamed that I attached my self-worth to what people thought of me and what I looked like. I was ashamed that I didn't handle my challenges better. I was ashamed that I didn't open up sooner. These were sobering conclusions, but they were necessary to shine a light on the darkness within me. Once I surfaced these barriers, I sought to dismantle them: Pride- I was only a failure if Ididn'task for help. Suppressing my struggles to the point of a panic attack was ludicrous. By asking for help, I'd be exercising my independence. I'd be admitting that I didn't have all the answers, which was a level of maturity and self-awareness that most people never reach. Fear- What if something worse happened to me because I didn't open up? How would my family feel then? That would be much scarier. As for rejection: would theyreallythink less of me? Of course not. I had many people in my corner rooting for me. Shame- My value and worth came from God, not from what people thought of me or whether I could climb a staircase. My insecurities were understandable -- no one likes being stared at -- but my disability didn't make me inferior. There was also no shame in making mistakes; no one handles adversity perfectly. Andeveryonestruggles to ask for help. I knew that these barriers were paper tigers, but for transformative change to happen, I would need more time. In September, my parents came to visit a few days before my 27th birthday. When I opened my apartment door, they were taken aback by my condition. My hair was unkempt. I had bags under my eyes. I hadn't shaved in days. Instead of being in a celebratory mood, my mom could see, once again, that something wasn't right. \"What's wrong?\" she asked as she settled into my leather desk chair. I looked over at my dad, who was standing in the kitchen pulling groceries out of plastic bags. They both looked at me with concern, deciphering my body language, waiting for a response. Habit implored me to resist.I'm fine.But I knew, deep down, that this was my chance. This was the moment I had been working so hard to overcome. I took a gulp of water on my nightstand. Before I had a chance to stop myself, the words finally,mercifully, tumbled out: \"I'm struggling.\" \"How so?\" My mom was concerned but composed. I would later learn she was relieved I finally expressed what they had known for months. I took a deep breath. \"Just....the weight of everything that's happened the last few years. The weakness. The falls.Carly passing away. I'm about to turn 27, and I don't feel like I have much to show for it. No girlfriend. My job has stagnated. I keep thinking about the future, all the uncertainty. I'm not sure how I'm going to deal with it.\" An uneasy silence lingered in the air. Finally, my mom spoke. \"You're going to face this withus, with Jen, with your friends. You don't have to face this alone. You know that, right?\" \"Yes.\" \"How long have you felt this way?\" my dad chimed in from the kitchen. I sat down on my bed and sighed. A wave of relief rushed over me. \"A long time. A really long time.\" And with that, the weight of the world lifted. In the weeks after my parents' visit, whenever we talked, they made it a point to ask me detailed questions. Even if they couldn't solve every issue I faced, they at leastknewwhat the issues were now. They vowed to help me in any way possible. But most importantly, they validated my feelings. I didn't realize how much I needed the validation until I received it. For so long, I thought my struggles were unique, that they were the byproduct of errant thought processes, deep-seated insecurities, and dumb mistakes. Hearing that I wasn't crazy made all the difference. Opening up to my parents provided a blueprint I could use with other relationships in my life. Whenever a friend or coworker asked how I was doing, instead of saying \"I'm fine,\" I let them know about my fear of getting new adaptive equipment or that I was concerned about an upcoming strength test at the hospital. When I talked to my boss, I didn't shy away from the fact that it was getting harder to commute to and from work every day. She suggested I work from home more often. When I grabbed drinks with my former roommates before Thanksgiving -- the ones I hadn't told about my disease for two years -- I knew I had to be more open. By hiding my symptoms from them for so long, I caused unnecessary drama when I had to break our lease because I could no longer climb stairs. \"I should have told you sooner, you know?\" I said in a contemplative moment, beer aiding in my courage. \"I made things so much harder than they needed to be.\" I don't blame myself anymore for how I handled the early years of my disease. So much was changing, so quickly. Although I wish I had built an infrastructure of support and love from the get-go, once I realized that everyone wanted to help me, once I realized that my struggles and challenges weren't unique, I was able to course correct. But it wasn't all smooth sailing. It was one thing to tell people I needed help; it was another to take them up on it. Soon, life would give me the chance to see how much progress I had made. In early January, I slipped and fell in the middle of an intersection near my apartment in Cambridge. Good Samaritans helped me to my feet, but the incident left me bloody and shaken up. Another few seconds and I would have been flattened by oncoming traffic. I thought about holding it in, hiding the event from those closest to me. Instead, when I called my parents that night to discuss their upcoming trip, I told them what happened, details I would have left out in the past. \"I'm glad you told us,\" my dad said. \"Perhaps the treads on your sneakers have worn out. Do you need us to go shoe shopping when we come up?\" I turned my sneakers over. The tread was smooth on the right heel, where I slipped. I was so consumed by the incident that I hadn't thought of why it happened. \"You're right. It was the shoes.\" Sometimes, the most effective help is walking alongside someone's hurt and brainstorming solutions. My dad was always a problem-solver; it felt good to let him do what he did best. The more I shared my struggles, the faster I climbed out of the abyss. The tough moments continued, but by talking to people, by letting them know that life was a grind, a funny thing happened: my panic attacks disappeared. I still hit walls. I still had bouts of depression. I still had moments when I wasn't able to verbalize my feelings. But instead of clamming up, I resolved to tell people. Even if I didn't feel comfortable sharing every last concern and fear, telling them something was better than nothing. Every incremental ask for help strengthened my relationships. I felt closer to my family now that I knew we were in this fight together. I also grew closer to my Boston friends, who ran errands, bought me food, and texted me periodically to check in. My support system grew, brick by brick, to the point where, in early February, I felt comfortable enough with my progress to take arguably the biggest risk of my life: leaving my job in the fall to get my MBA. Business school would be the ultimate test. There was no way I could get through a 2-year, full-time MBA program without relying on multiple people -- family, friends, and classmates -- for support. It would take a village to help with the logistics of getting to and from campus, going to social events, navigating group projects and classwork, and interviewing for jobs. In mynot-asking-for-helpdays, this goal felt unattainable. But now? With the right support, I at least had a chance. I applied and got into several schools in the Boston area, ultimately deciding on Boston College. But it wasn't a done deal. The night before I had to let BC know my decision, I barely slept. I couldn't figure out if this was an achievable goal, or if I was leading myself headlong into disaster. Could I really do this? Would my mind and body hold up? I went into work -- deadline day -- unsure what decision I'd make. Now that I had to choose, I felt the consequential weight of the moment. Either way, my life would never be the same. The web portal was open on my browser for several hours. Not only was it two years of my life I would be signing over, it was also a hefty non-refundable deposit. I didn't want to say yes, only to reverse my decision a week later. At lunch, a few of my coworkers gathered around my desk. The deadline was only three hours away. \"Well? What did you decide?\" I felt the familiar urge to recoil, to run away from a challenge beyond my strength. But I knew that if I was willing to rely on others for support -- including my friends standing next to me -- I would be just fine. I looked up from the screen and smiled. \"I'm going.\" About the Author Chris Anselmo is a Connecticut resident living with an adult-onset neuromuscular disease called limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B.

    "data": "When we're captivated by something greater than ourselves in a shared moment of wonder, we see each other in a whole new light. And later, when we relive these wondrous moments through storytelling--days, months, years later--we rediscover each other in a new light. I recently listened to a friend's awe-inspiring encounter of being in the path of totality for the solar eclipse in April this year. She had traveled from Boston to Ohio to reach her perfect viewing spot and fortunately, the weather was ideal for the full spectacle. Weeks later, she shared those powerful moments that had taken her breath away with me and a friend--andourbreath was taken away just listening to her story. We got chills right along with her as she held us in suspenseful detail, allowing us to be in that moment of awe with her. We felt something greater than ourselves had unified all three of us in this profound moment of amazement. Indeed, millions of Americans felt a collective sense of awe during the eclipse: \"Oh, wow --I've never seen anything like this!\" Their awe generated deep emotions, tears of gratitude, chills of excitement, reverence, a sense of oneness with others, an affirmation of life. For such a brief and fleeting event, the eclipse had an enormous impact. In the same spirit, I've enjoyed watching stories of people viewing the Aurora Borealis in May of this year as Americans gazed at these stunning lights for the first time. And on a completely different awe-inspiring topic, it's heartening to hear the stories from awestruck fans of Taylor Swift about being in a live audience of 60,000 (even though I'm not a Swiftie). And I've been captivated by the (comeback) performances of gymnast Simone Biles after her brave advocacy for the mental health challenges of athletes. And just last night, I'm still wowed by that amazing half-court shot by Boston Celtics player Payton Pritchard at the buzzer. The awe-inspiring vibes are contagious through stories that relive the moment--from eclipse viewers, Aurora Borealis enthusiasts, ecstatic Swifties, or astonished sports fans. Quite simply, in these cynical and pessimistic times, I'm awestruck when I see other people awestruck. Even vicariously, enjoying these moments of awe and wonder gives me a boost of faith in humanity. Certainly, humans are wired for collective experiences of awe and wonder, and we seem to be hungry for these experiences. Neuroscience Validates Sharing Our Experiences of Awe Neuroscience has shown us how these powerful moments of awe allow us to see ourselves in a whole new light. Awe is considered to be a self-transcendingemotion--a state of mind that stretches our awareness beyond our habitual patterns of thinking. Essentially awe grabs our attention away from our self-referential thoughts and pulls us out of our self-absorption. Psychologist and author Dacher Keltner has called our sense of self within this expanded, vast perspective our \"small self,\" an awareness of being a small part of a much wider world beyond our own lives. This vast, all-inclusive sense of oneness helps us feel humility and compassion for others around us. (Keltner's bestseller,Awe: The New Science of Everyday Wonder and How It Can Transform Your Lifeis a friendly introduction to the topic.) In a BBC article, \"Awe: the 'little earthquake' that could free your mind,\" University of Michigan psychologist Ethan Kross describes awe as \"thewonderwe feel when we encounter something powerful that we can't easily explain.\" Awe and wonder leave us speechless and stunned for a moment, a pause--an instant change that resets our thought patterns. Kross adds, \"When you are in the presence of something vast and indescribable, you feel smaller, and so does your negative chatter.\" Kross has conducted studies with PTSD survivors including military veterans and youth from underserved communities. One study where participants joined in a rafting trip in Utah demonstrated how their feelings of awe predicted better outcomes in their well-being months later. In short, when we experience awe, we turn our attention outwards instead of inwards. We are better able to attune to one another in the moment. It appears this attuning to one another, shifting our attention outward, also happens when we share our stories of awe and wonder. Social psychologist Michelle Shiota, a researcher at Arizona State University, describes getting out of our \"predictive coding\" about what is supposed to happen next when we open to an awe experience, even when we hear the story from the experiencer. Awe allows us to break out of our expectations, assumptions, and biases about what we think is supposed to happen as the experience unfolds. \"The mind dials back its 'predictive coding' to just look around and gather information.\" So, awe literally puts reality right in front of us. Our minds practically gasp when we're overcome with awe--we \"get it\" on some level even if we cannot explain it. So, when we are experiencing moments of awe with others in storytelling, we welcome these powerful, inexplicable experiences that snap us out of our habitual mindsets and expectations. When we share our stories of awe, we are allowing our listeners to \"dial back\" their own \"predictive coding\" and just be there with our experience as if we are all feeling it for the first time. The Healing through Wonder Project I've not only been excited about neuroscience research on awe and wonder but I've been inspired to gather storytellers to share their life-changing experiences. I've created a YouTube channel calledHealing Through Wonderwhere my co-host, Robyn Houston-Bean, founder ofThe Sun Will Rise Foundation, and I interview guests who tell their stories of healing from transformative encounters with awe and wonder. We invite guests who are facing grief after the loss of a loved one due to substance use, as well as guests who've survived trauma and addiction, to share their awe-inspiring experiences. Many of our guests have attributed these transformative moments of awe to being a turning point in their healing--their lives have never been the same since that shift in their awareness. With ourHealing Through Wonderchannel, Robyn and I have created a friendly platform to claim and celebrate our healing encounters with awe, such as breathtaking moments with wildlife, with dreams, music, spiritual revelations, and more. We believe everyone has a \"wonder story\" and we've witnessed how sharing our story inspires listeners to explore and welcome future experiences of wonder. Indeed, healing moments of awe and wonder arecontagiouslyuplifting as well as meaningful. We get goosebumps and feel a sense of oneness and closeness with each other when we share a moment that took our breath away.

    "data": "On September 28th, as part ofHUBWEEK2016, Health Story Collaborative hosted one of ourHealing Story Sessionsat thePaul S. Russell, MD, Museum of Medical History and Innovation. Healing Story Sessions are live storytelling events founded on the belief that story sharing is healing. In preparation for these sessions, we work closely with participants to construct their stories of illness and healing and to become comfortable sharing their stories in spoken word in front of an audience. Typically, story sharers invite a group of community members to witness their stories in a safe and supportive environment. On September 28, in a departure from our norm, we opened the event to the public. We had three courageous story sharers. In the coming weeks, we will feature the written stories and the accompanying videos from the live event. We encourage you to read and watch. As our first feature, we bring you Michele Foley. Michele is living with Stage 4 Melanoma. Her story is brave and beautiful. For the event, she shared the stage with her son, Andy, currently a second year Harvard Medical School student. Stay tuned for his story next week. By Michele Foley Andrew reminds me of a story I often forget. It is a story of becoming stronger, forgiving myself, laughing at myself, connecting with others. He reminds me -with his questions and focused listening -how sacred it is to share in someone's story. I thank him for his sublime attention to my medical experience over these years. His willingness to be so involved inspires action within me, and action from others. He wraps his positive energy around me--and he might not know till now, how he has held me together and kept me walking forward. 2010At crossroads in my life. Our answer to the empty nest? My husband and I take flight ourselves- new college jobs in the Southern Allegheny Mountains of rural Pennsylvania. Initially empty nest for me is filled with a sense of loss for what I called home: 28 years of memories with our three sons, close friends, a high school teaching routine. Change evokes a gut-wrenching ache. Where is everyone I have been centered on for the last twenty-nine years? I am off-balance. Why is my reaction to withdraw and isolate myself? Why cling to the familiar, and long for whathasbeen? \"Give yourself time,\" my sister reminds me. Time to listen, pay attention, so I start to open my eyes to my new world. I drive back and forth every day, up and down the Cresson Summit, 2,430 feet above sea level. I notice massive cloud formations, September blue skies, sunsets, stars, and moonlight with magnificence like never before. College chapel bells bless each hour, adding sounds familiar from my neighborhood as a child that bring comfort. Let this new adventure be an example of what I want to tell others: get up, get out and walk boldly into your life. \"Shine on,\" those chapel bells sing. And so we do. Poet Nina Bogan's lines capture my feeling then: When I walked up the road, the string sack Heavy on my arms, I thought That my legs could carry me anywhere, Into any country, any life... One year later I am rambling back on the train from NYC to the college, to my new home. Sent to the big city to attend the JED Foundation Gala, I finish with my five hours of fun and fancy. I return to work in the train's quiet car. Answering a call from the surgeon's office, I step out between shifting train cars, struggling to keep my balance, and lean on the aluminum wall to take notes. I cannot hear the medical assistant's voice and ask her to repeat and spell the results. I copy her exact words on a remnant scrap and keep it in my hand, returning to my seat. I struggle to keep my inner balance. This can't be good.Exceedingly rare neoplastic cells positive for Melanin A, HMB-45, S-100 features consistent with metastatic deposit. Malignant metastasized melanoma.No. Not this, not now. I am just into my new life. If I don't say it aloud, look at the words scribbled on the paper, I might not have it. I will deal with this myself. Alone. No one else needs to get upset or derail their lives. Not so much sorry for myself, I feel sorry that I must begin to tell family about this. Once I disclose the diagnosis, I will have no control over others' reactions. I don't want to be the reason my husband is upset, my sons are sad. I return the next day to have sutures removed. Maybe there is a mistake in the lab report. Staff stare at me as if I am dead. Even the surgeon gives me a hug, \"god blesses\" me, hopes I have my \"things in order.\" I can't leave fast enough. I bolt to my car, roll down the windows in the sweltering Ford, sit quietly, and notice bells dreadfully tolling the noon hour from the nearby rundown cathedral. \"For whom the bells tolls, it tolls for thee.\"Doomed, done, those bells keep telling me. Surgery tolls. Driving to the hospital, I command my husband a la ultimatum. \"If they can remove the cancer completely, but need to take my leg--fine. If they go in, the cancer is everywhere, lymph nodes and all, keep the leg intact and let it be.\" Not long ago I felt \"my legs could carry me anywhere.\" Foolish to think I am in command. Come, Holy Spirit, fire me up. Keep me warm as I shiver pre-op. I ask for boldness of heart, I ask for patience with the unfolding of life, I ask for joy. Come what may. Good thing I memorized it. Pre-op needles in, monitors beeping, it all signals solemnity. Post op results -Tumor exceedingly rare.We have never seen this (tumor type) before. So I am \"one in a million?\" Ah, it makes my stomach ache. Can't this be ordinary? Please no, not exceedingly rare.I like to think I am one in a million but not like this! My bubbly Brazilian surgeon exudes optimism and hope. I try to share his outlook. It lasts three days. Floodgates open when, with water from the shower, I make my first attempt at loosening the bandage. There it is, a twelve-inch gash spanning my left outer thigh. Raw, jagged, unfamiliar- I begin to sob. My life-long optimism betrayed bythis. It felt like I was being mocked--ha-- \"my legs could carry me anywhere.\" I was going nowhere. I was heading straight to the Interferon lab. \"Give yourself time to heal,\" my son Matt coaches. The scar healed; I started to fall apart, needing constant reassurance that all of the cancer was removed, margins clear and everything under control. Guaranteed, right? Patient patient I am not; setting new goals helps. I will walk again without a hitch. I will wear long pants forevermore. I will never go to the beach again, only to be mocked by the sun. I, I, I, now seems silly. Pace myself? Who am I kidding? My body will let me know. Let go. No control. Let it, allow it, flow with it. Practice it. Make it my practice. Learn again. Again and again. Work to get my balance back. Identify what gives me strength, go after it. Slow and steady. \"Take your time,\" my husband reminds me. This is not a race. 2011. 2012. 2013. 2014. 2015No evidence of metabolically active recurrent or metastatic disease.With each checkup I move a little closer to lightness of being. The remarkable feeling of seeing reports that deem organs \"unremarkable\" brings a smile. My ordinary life swings back with tutoring, teaching, editing. I act as if the summer of surgeries is a distant past. Deep within though there's the tolling. I am aware of time ticking both in my head and heart. It counts the time I may have with my people; it counts the time until the next scan. I try to remind myself: Be open. Be alive. Pick up what is right there in front of you--this gift! 2015Routine PET scan reveals spot on left lower lung.I feel that shot to the gut again. Unfortunately default mode kicks in. I go to clinic appointments alone. I go to biopsy alone. My heart pounds. My head throbs. Tears well up but not out.Metastatic melanoma Stage IV. Medical plan RadVac. It is on the move, in my bloodstream, everywhere. I go to radiation appointments alone. My arms hurt. This is too much for me to carry. Our son Matt is getting married to Katie in a few weeks. Wedding bells should be ringing, not the tick tock, chime, timer, bells tolling that my time is up. Off-balance. I steel myself. I will carry this latest news myself. When will I learn? I tell my people. It is happening to all of us, our son, Andrew reminds me. We will walk this next part together. After two weeks of radiation and one Pembrolizumab treatment, wedding bells chime! Our son Tommy, reminds me to feel all the love that fills, overflows in our home. I stand off to the side looking at our yard filled with a circle of love-all of us enjoying a summer eve together. I listen: belly laughing and belching; crickets' song and sounds of kids. Listen hard. What a fool I'd be to isolate myself from all of this wonder-filled-ness. Balanced and buoyed. I gather strength, more than I ever knew from those who love me. It is the ordinary time we spend that is the best: taking a walk, prepping a meal, pulling weeds in the yard, collecting sweetie tomatoes, icing up a glass of cold water and surprising the other with it. Such comfort in the beautiful ordinary day. \"What's good?\" my son asks, just to remind me. Along the way, it has been a challenge to find the energy to always begin again: new treatment, new clinics, new procedures, new side effects, new allergies, new story -that is the norm. Gather again and again the beginner's mind. Inner balance is what I am spending time on, and implementing a plan to keep strong. I begrudgingly take time to attend to symptoms of the pembrolizumab treatment. My sister chimes in, \"Be as good to yourself as you are to me, to others.\" Only after that can I spin into the ordinary day: tutoring, editing, walking, practicing yoga, humming, being grateful. I am the luckiest person on the planet. I have imposed only three goals this time around. One, I limit my thought/conversation about the melanoma on an ordinary day to max ten minutes. This includes internet research, telephone conversation, complaining to family. The timer is set and when it chimes--DONE. Two, taper back on daily work--some tutoring, editing continues. Three, tend to the wellness to keep balanced. I admit all that attention makes me weary. No shortcuts. Fresh fruit and veggies, green tea, yogurt, kefir, beans, broth; then start over again shopping and preparing. A cup of tea, a homemade blueberry muffin, good company: today's recipe for feeling fully alive. There are a few aspects that I am working on these days. *What does life as \"normal\" after cancer look like? Loved ones just want to see the old \"me\" back as a sign that all is well. Gone, she has moved on * In my quest to pay more attention to detail, I try to work and stay ahead of whatever symptom is presenting, no matter how small. This self-compassion and self-coaching has been helpful in keeping my brain focused on a plan to affect a better outcome. * I have pledged full disclosure always to family (in so doing I model what I hope will be same for us all). * I am terrible about asking for something for myself, so that is my subset of full disclosure. Not edit, sugar coat, back pedal, apologize, or cry. Name it; claim it and move through it. This is applicable from extremes: craving butter almond ice cream to refusing to go to the next scheduled treatment. 2016Currently, I am on hold after 8 Pembrolizumab infusion treatments. Last scans just in August were straightforward.No new evidence of metastatic disease in the chest, lower left lobe. Nodular component near the medial margin measures 0.9cm and is unchanged since 5/16/2016. There are no new pulmonary nodules.Like Poetry.Details regarding this type of melanoma say it is least receptive to targeted drug therapy.Darn again, that one in a million! The plan is to monitor and report symptoms to clinic every three weeks. No travel. Follow up PET scan. It feels good putting a bit of distance between clinic visits now. So I approach this interim as time to get my second wind. I want to be present to the here (and hear) and now, taking it all in--saturating my sense as I pause often during an ordinary day. I continue to pray to have the guts to be able to \"carry\" whatever comes next. Not really sure if that points to me or to those I love. No matter. Lately a sense of great freedom is emerging - having faced a bit of darkness. How to get back a bit of the \"my legs can carry me anywhere?\" Get up, get out and walk boldly into your life.Begin to hit the tennis ball, plant basil, bake Irish soda bread, dab on lavender, walk two-a-days, occasionally buy agoodcup o'coffee. In a monumental turnabout, I have moved from \"I have to take care of everyone\" to \"Good morning glory. Let me gather my strength and be of help today.\" I am humming along with guarded optimism, knowing the limits to that I can control. So I have retired from some of my favorite avocations: running my brother's life, offering childrearing advice, meddling as the smother-in-law, badgering students about Thirsty Thursday when a paper is due Friday, forwarding TED talks to 30 on my contacts list, arguing with my hubby. Postscript As the Joan Didion quote says, \"We tell ourselves stories in order to live.\" The story I tell myself is to get up, get out, and walk boldly into life. Over and over again I realize how lucky I am. Andrew shared with us a quote during his first week at Harvard Medical School: \" Life is short and we have never enough time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the journey with us. Oh be swift to love, make haste to be kind\". This is my avocation now. This narrative unearthed so much that was unspoken, tucked away, intentionally forgotten. Wrestling with, loving, crying, remembering, speaking, listening, forgetting, and forgiving--all messy indeed. It has been cathartic and calls me to be courageous. As the psalm says, for what has been, thanks. For what is to come, yes.",

    "data": "\"It was incredibly hard. I learned more than I ever thought possible.\" My childhood friend Allison had asked me about my third year of medical school, which is notorious for being challenging, overwhelming, exhausting, rewarding, and exhilarating. The first two years of medical school are typical school with weekday classes and unit tests every few weeks. Then during third year (called \"core clinical\" year), we are immersed in the day-to-day work of being a physician. We spend approximately 8 weeks working with resident teams in the hospital in each of the core medical disciplines: internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, and psychiatry. At the end of each rotation, we complete a national exam. I went into third year expecting to apply, reinforce, and build upon the book knowledge accrued during my first two years of medical school, blissfully unaware of the uncertainties and philosophical challenges inherent to a patient's medical care. But during third year, I mainly had to learn acceptance. Acceptance that medical decisions are rarely obvious, that internal validation need not be secondary to external validation, and that the best patient care starts with proper self-care. As medical students, we have a vague understanding of the limitations of medicine. A Wall Street Journal article entitled \"Why Doctors Die Differently\" by Dr. Ken Murray details the phenomenon of medical professionals utilizing fewer medical services than the average American when making end-of-life decisions. Medical professionals witness patients receiving interventions that prolong the days, but sacrifice the quality, of life. People who work in medicine see the tolls that CPR, feeding tubes, and ventilators place on already vulnerable patients. The general public has been primed by the media to see these treatments as more often life-saving than not. Those without medical backgrounds hear what is possible; but medical professionals recognize what is realistic. During medical school, we are taught the contraindications to certain procedures or treatments. There is rarely discussion about what to do in that murky in between: when something can be done, but may not be in the patient's best interest. I will never forget a patient I had on internal medicine whose daughter demanded he be \"full code\", meaning that if the patient went into cardiac arrest he would receive CPR and a breathing tube to be kept alive. The patient was 88-years-old, with metastatic colon cancer and an infection in his blood. I felt for the daughter of the patient. She had no other experience with this sort of care. I also felt for the medical provider, who described that giving this patient CPR would be inflicting immense pain and suffering (ribs break during CPR) to a patient who had an already poor prognosis. These situations were common in the hospital. In these moments, I felt as if I existed in limbo. I resided in the in-between space; I was both the medical professional and the patient's daughter. It was from this vantage that I realized everyone has the same goal: self-preservation while acting in the patient's best interest. Each side just approaches the situation from a different angle. End-of-life discussions were the moments when I grew the most. All of the physiology, pharmacology, and anatomy that I fervently studied meant very little when trying to quantify the quality of a patient's life. I came to understand that sometimes, the best thing to do is step back, assess the bigger picture, and ask ourselves what we are trying to accomplish. I also took stalk of my own life during third year. I have always put pressure on myself to be \"the best\" and honed study skills over the years so that I know what I need to succeed. In third year, the evaluations by our attendings and residents are also factored in to our final grade. The way a student's personality, interests, and sense of humor jived with a resident's often reflected the student's grade more than anything else. In the beginning of the year, I would often change my interests and style to fit that of the attending. I approach medicine from a bio-psycho-social perspective, but many of the doctors with whom I worked did not. Often, a doctor would scoff at the socio-economic factors involved in the patient's health. I would feign disinterest, if only to appease the resident. As the year went on, I came to value my opinion of myself more than any one attending or resident's opinion of me. Patients went out of their way to thank me for my help and ask for me to be there with them during procedures, which reassured me that my approach is valid. Though I did not always receive the best numerical grade, I was able to sleep better knowing that I provided patients with what I believed to be the best possible care. Third year forced me to consider the big questions. I needed to come to terms with the impossibility of being \"the best\", realizing that it can be easy to become so hyper-focused that we neglect what's truly important. I faced my fears: not only will I not excel at everything, but I can't expect myself to. I realized that ethical gray areas exist, and that what I typically worried about didn't really matter. I had to start balancing self-care with self-actualization, and for that I would not trade anything. Alyssa Wohl is a now fourth-year medical student from New York. She is hoping to work as an Adolescent Medicine doctor. She enjoys chocolate, yoga, and spending time with her two pugs.",

    "data": "By Els Messelis My eyes don't line up with one another and that will be for the rest of my life. I have tried to live a full life but realize that I have to live an 'SOC' life based on Selection, Optimalization and Compensation. The SOC model was first introduced by Paul and Margaret Baltes as a psychological model of successful aging applicable to a variety of functional domains like cognition, emotion, and motivation (Freund, 2008). This model builds on the belief that across the lifespan, people face certain opportunities (e.g., education) and limitations (e.g., illness) that can be successfully navigated by an orchestration of three components: selection, optimization, and compensation. Life story of my eyes, seen through my eyes When I take off my glasses, you can tell I have crossed eyes. But my loved ones have never insisted on extra eye operations, although all the previous ones failed. When I was three years old, I was diagnosed with Strabismus (crossed eyes). A predisposition and the context influenced it: all of my other illnesses made my eye problems come to light. In the beginning, I never realized what impact this diagnosis would have on my life. 54 years later - I am 58 now - I realize more than ever that I cannot run away from my eye problems any longer because they have become more and more a part of my life and my aging process. Dr. Annie Brewster, founder of Health Story Collaborative, might not be aware of the fact that she opened my eyes with her health story in March 2022 during the International Congress on 'The Healing Power of Storytelling'. But she did. The mask came off, even though I had been working for years with life stories of my (older) clients. As a gerontologist and author, I lecture, read, and write all day long. I like to share this passion and I love to let my clients, students, patients grow. This gives me flow, energy, and happiness. This means that I use my eyes all the time for reading and writing. I do not give them the rest they need so much. A difficult memory Some of the experiences I have had throughout my life with my eye problems have been dehumanizing. Up until I was ten years old, I received several treatments: glasses, patching, eye exercises and 4 surgeries. Eyes are complex. Why do I have crossed eyes? Why could eye specialists not fix my problems? So many questions have never been answered. The optic nerve is a bundle of more than 1 million nerve fibers. It transmits sensory information for vision in the form of electrical impulses from the eye to the brain. I have never known for sure if I have optic nerve damage. I also wonder, do I have optic neuropathy? This is a catch-all term that refers to damage inflicted on the optic nerve. I think this is sometimes the case. When I was five years old, both of my eyes received surgery. The loneliness I felt when I awoke was hard to carry because I couldn't see anything. But I did receive a doll who was as tall as me. What happiness I felt when I recovered from the surgery! It still puts a smile on my face. Another dehumanizing moment happened when I was told at ten years old that I would never be able to earn a proper degree at school: \"You will have to live with it, you will never be able to go to University. Your eyes cannot cope with long reading and long writing...\" I was perplexed and from then on I had plans to overcome this! Around that time, I was also ashamed because my eyes were covered and I wore glasses which were too thick to look nice. I looked like I had Goblet glasses. When I was 18, I planned to earn a bachelor's degree in social work, which I did. After that, I became a teacher with no particular problems. The eye problems resumed when I was in my early 30's. While I was studying Medical Social Sciences and afterwards Gerontology, I had to study for examinations and had just finished my Master Thesis when I began having severe eye problems. A neurologist advised me not to read and write for a month! I had to hold complete rest. I was shocked and astonished. This felt dehumanizing because I wanted to finish my master's degree on time with good results. Luckily, I had started early to prepare for examinations. I ended up Cum Laude, with distinction. But I was broken. I had to rest for weeks before I could properly read and write. The same happened again several years later. I had been an academic researcher at the Free University of Brussels. I had finished my PhD. In my 'little jury,' I received the advice to review my PhD, but I never did. The combination of my eye problems (one eyeball was gone), a divorce, and the fact my mother-in-law passed away, my energy and motivation were gone. \"Your PhD is too good to throw away, but it needs an in-depth review.\" I had plans to do so, but in December 2006 I met my new partner who had four children; I became Doctor of the Dirty Laundry. My dream to become a PhD in Gerontology was over. It took me more than two years to recover from this, as I always had believed if you start something, you should finish it to the end with good results. I did not take time to fully recover, but started writing articles and books as author or as co-author. In the summer of 2022, and for the first time since 2006, I have received severe eye problems again. For years I have been working on big computer screens. But all the online lessons and meetings were a disadvantage for my eyes. I could not read the shared documents well. Sometimes I am working 10-12 hours at my PC in combination with social media on my iPhone and my eyes cannot do this much longer. Long reading and long writing is a problem for me, but there are so many books that have to be read and so many other books and articles that have to be written. Alternative stories: the art to survive In my narrative work as Gerontologist, I collect lifestories on 'skinhunger' and 'loneliness'. I have come across old and young people who have opened their hearts on very emotional themes, often hidden stories. I want to share my hidden story. I have always believed that stories have the power to transform individuals as well as the health care system. After being in contact with the Health Story Collaborative, and reading the bookThe Healing Power of Storytelling, I am more and more convinced. Lessons learned Sharing my story can be interesting for me but also for others. Stressing the positive aspects in life and integrating the negative ones by looking for new pathways: it is liberating. Art-therapy, creative writing and using other materials have helped me in supporting my clients. I realize that I also can help me forward. I have started classes on creative writing and I will take an educational course on art-therapy. It can help me process what comes next, to create new pathways to thrive and even reclaim my personal power amid uncertainty, fear and change. I realize more than ever that I am 57 and that I will come more and more in contact with \"normal\" eye problems for my age, such as accommodation problems, above my other eye problems. My heart longs to read and write for days, but my eyes often say, \"I cannot participate.\" I have to listen to my body and make new pathways on my healing journey. As mentioned in the book of Dr. Brewster, there can be some things realized in the healing power of storytelling. She mentions important aspects such as: Process the difficult emotion that come with life-changing diagnosis. Move beyond being the hero of your own story to become the author of your own story Craft your narrative and share it in whatever medium speaks to you: art, writing, music, audio Integrate a traumatic health event into a new and ending identity Use applied storytelling techniques to strengthen connections between you and your loved ones Cultivate resilience to move forward amid uncertainty and fear Let us share hidden stories and learn from each other. So we can connect in solidarity, and live in a warm society. This is what we all want, no? Due to my glasses, most of the time, it looks there is nothing wrong with me, but there is...sometimes in a very severe and bad way. I am so passionate about my work - which is in a huge amount writing and reading - that the spot is always on. Sometimes, my eyes say: \"I don't want to cooperate any longer.\" Life can be compared with roses. Life is often beautiful but we have to cope with the thorns. Integrating them is the way to go but not always easy. My new goals in life based on the SOC model: Els Messelishas a Masters in Gerontology and is coauthor of 13 books on older age.

    "data": "By Glenis Redmond I got the gift of gab from my Dad. My fourth-grade teacher, Mrs. Kathrine Priest, wrote on my report card in the English section: oral work is excellent; Glenis enjoys talking, acting, and singing before the other children. I hope she develops this talent. I was that kid, the animated kinesthetic one acting out any story or scene with dance, humor, and timing. I was always the student called upon to read stories and poems out loud. Once, my teacher asked me to read \"I Wandered as Lonely as a Cloud\" by William Wordsworth, and my classmates met me with wild applause. I felt not only heard but seen. In retrospect, Mrs. Priest was very strict and stern, yet she was one of the only teachers who saw the storyteller in me. Wherever she is now, I hope she can see that I developed my talent by becoming a poet and a teaching artist. Who knew while running around the world professionally telling stories for twenty-seven years that I would end up here--fighting for my life in my 55th year? Maybe I should have known something was wrong when I had developed a dull throb at the base of my back and that my knee hurt so bad that I had a noticeable limp. I was hobbling around the office at the Peace Center, where I was the Poet-in-Residence. I took no real note of my gait until a co-worker asked, \"What happened to you?\" I brushed her off with a clipped response, \"Oh, it's just my Fibromyalgia acting up. I thought it was just that. I have been dealing with Fibromyalgia since 1992, which meant I was accustomed to muscle pain and flu-like symptoms. I had learned to push through. However, on this day, my co-worker just shook her head and raised one eyebrow, and this non-verbal communication of concern was enough for me to schedule an appointment with my nurse practitioner. She advised me that we should do a complete physical with blood work. I told her that I was leaving for a poetry residency in New Brunswick, New Jersey, for the State Theatre in a few days and would be gone for three weeks. She said, \"Let's do it when you return. The physical will be six months early, but do not worry; your insurance will pay.\" I agreed. I was dubious that the physical or the blood work would reveal anything because my last physical was routine with no red flags. I thought this was just the slippery life of Fibromyalgia, and all I needed to do was rest and take muscle relaxers to gain my footing again. So off, I went on my 21-day poetry community residency in New Jersey, which consisted of at least three to four engagements daily. The events included poetry readings or workshops, which could occur at a school, a corporation, a conference, a prison, a halfway house, a detention home, or a church. As a former counselor, poet, and teaching artist, I aim to create safe spaces for participants. In each setting, my goal is not necessarily to make people poets but to make them aware of the poetry in their lives. It is challenging but gratifying work. At one school, the principal apologized; he told me he was glad I was there, but these students would not want to learn poetry and were gang members. By the end of our time together, I got buy-in; these young people shared heartbreaking stories through their poetry. They moved me so much that I wrote a poem called \"Bruised.\" The poem ends like this: I know this detour we took/ down old roads is a place we had to go,/ places where we have been loved so hard it hurts,/so hard we are still bruised./ We bear our scars,/ then we pick up our pens/and write. The red X on my map that said I AM HERE was not so much a geographical locator but defined my identity, how I saw myself, and how others saw me----a Mama, a Gaga, a Black woman poet, and a fierce literary citizen. I stand firmly in poetry and my outreach of it. I also embrace the unconventional artist road life that I live. However, my May calendar that year was packed as always, but it felt more taxing. During the residency, I was dragging and exhausted. I knew something was off at my core. I pushed and pushed through. When I returned home, the terrain of my life swiftly became unrecognizable. I had my blood work done before I returned to the doctor for my physical. I saw the red flags on MyChart populate. Eventually, I noticed that I had a Monoclonal M-spike. I copied and pasted that phrase into Google. Instead of fifteen possibilities of how I would meet my demise, there was only one option: Multiple Myeloma. In the privacy of my own home, I learned that this meant blood cancer. I did not cry; I went numb. I did not tell my Mother or my twin daughters Amber and Celeste immediately. I kept this knowledge to myself until the official diagnosis. I dreaded telling them and I hoped the blood test was wrong. However, when my nurse practitioner entered the room at my appointment, she had tears in her eyes. I told her that I already knew. I felt immense shame and failure. Who was I without caring for my family and friends and traveling the world giving poetry away? I had lost my footing. This was quite a turn; the caretaker had to be cared for. I began doing the cancer dance of weekly blood draws, chemotherapy, and steroids to get ready for a Stem Cell Transplant. This process all transpired during the six months before the pandemic. I had already been homebound before the rest of the world shut down. I had been saying that I needed to slow down for five years. Be careful of what you ask for; you might just get it. Stage III Multiple Myeloma told me to sit down--to have several seats. Being still is the most challenging work for a doer. This is when I discovered my screened-in patio. Who knew? I had a new relationship with it and the cast of characters that inhabited my backyard, Pine. Called it a winged thing perched on the soul From my backyard, I agree. Through the most challenging year of my life my feathered friends came through. The red streaks of the Cardinals dot the pine-like Christmas tree ornaments. The next day mourning doves wake the day with their sorrow-filled calls. Our state bird, the Carolina Wren, claims not only South Carolina but also my sanctuary; my heart belongs to the hummingbirds with their incandescent darting. Surely, good omens are to follow. Then, the brilliant blur of Eastern Bluebirds. Between the leaves, my eyes can never take in enough of this tarot reading of wings. I hold on as they lift off into the cerulean skies. People say that I've gone to the birds, I disagree. I believe. I've lived here all along. I spent most of my time at home with my grandson, Julian. He and his Mama, my daughter Amber, live with me. Julian was five years old when I was going through the most arduous stages of cancer. He and Amber both were my lifeline. Yet, I hated him seeing his Gaga sick, bald, and frail, but we are a multi-generational household. We both suffered. He had spectrum and sensory issues. I was dealing with not focusing too much on dying. While Amber was working, I taught him board games: checkers, Chutes and Ladders, Battleship, and Trouble. We had great fun, but we were the ones who were troubled. As I got stronger, we began frequenting the South Carolina State Parks. I knew we needed to be out in nature. We loved the adventure so much that we wanted to visit all forty-seven state parks to earn the Ultimate Outsider classification granted by the South Carolina State Parks. We have been to twenty-two. We had to do something to shift our outlooks. If I were to die during this cancer ordeal, I wanted Julian to have a treasure chest of memories that we had built. I eventually published a poetry book about our excursions,The Song of Everything: A Poet's Exploration of the South Carolina State Parks. This is an excerpt of a poem titled \"Dear Grandson\": \"Julian, I want you to know every wonder belongs to you, though some will say to you otherwise. Go anyhow: Your passage has already been paid. Be an Ultimate Outsider wherever you go. It's up to you to forge on. Remember, it's the destination and the journey. Remember our rain prayers. Remember, even when I have turned to nothing but air and am carried away by a strong Gale. Know I will be there with you out in the green and gold meadows in the gloaming. My hand will be in yours. I will be singing as everything sings to you. Grandson, listen with your whole self and with yourwhole self sing back.\" I wanted to live. I knew there was a good possibility that I could die, but I wanted to live for myself, especially for Julian and eventually for my newest grandchild, Paisley. [I now have another granddaughter, Quinn.] For six months, I was readying for the Stem Cell Transplant. At first, I did not look cancer-ish, with no hair loss and no weight loss. Many people told me that I looked good and didn't look sick. I was grateful for this small mercy, But often, I wanted to reply to that comment with, \"Multiple Myeloma is an inside job.\" When I finally reached the point that I was ready for a Stem Cell Transplant, I slid the most. I was having an autologous transplant. In other words, I was my own donor. This harvesting was not event-free, though I told it would be. My blood pressure went dangerously low. I eventually pulled through, and the next week, I was admitted to the hospital for my twenty-one-day stay. During this process, I had fear. I felt terror. I felt rage. I felt sorrow. I felt grief and loss, but I did not speak of it. The first day in the hospital, they gave me my cells back. Then, the next day, they gave me high-dose chemotherapy. This is when the fight began. I was in the wilderness. I did not know who I was, let alone where I was-- wild-eyed and weathered between pneumonia, vomiting, and constant diarrhea. I hung on with teeth and claw. During my stem cell transplant, my Mother would come and sit by my bed and not say much but stare at me as if she was lending me some strength to live. I was delirious, going in and out of a morphine haze. My daughter Celeste (one of my chief medical advocates) said I was conversing with people not in the room. I made it through this part of the woods. When I was released from the hospital after the Stem Cell Transplant, I was bald, bloated, and looking very much like my own grandfather. This is when I looked cancer-ish. I received gawks when I went out in public. There was no denying I had cancer. Though I had survived the worst and had achieved remission, I still had to return to the hospital for weekly infusions--yet all I wanted to do was go home to cocoon and heal in the comforts of my home. My hope was deflated. It was an uphill climb. I had pain from multiple sources. I had bone pain from Multiple Myeloma from lytic lesions on my skull, clavicle, and femur. I had muscle pain from Fibromyalgia. I had nerve pain from neuropathy in my feet and hands. In other words, it was and still is pain on top of pain on top of pain. I never went back to a 9 to 5 position because I am physically and psychically beat up. I lost so much, and I began to take stock of my losses: My livelihood. My gait. My energy. My ability to dance. I am a dancer. Think old school: Prince or Cameo. I could not walk around my neighborhood daily because it was too high impact, and it hurt. I couldn't wear my beloved Fluevogs shoes. I have a collection. Don't ask how many. My favorite is the metallic orange Bebop boots. Think Alice in Wonderland meets Parliament and the Funkadelics. I remember taking on virtual keynotes and poetry workshops too soon; I was very winded. People wanted the old me, and I wanted the old me, but she was not there. I needed to give myself more space to get stronger and healthier and learn who I was in this now. I am still reckoning with what I can and cannot do. I am fully aware of my limitations and the life expectancy of Multiple Myeloma patients diagnosed at Stage 3. Don't google the statistics. It is sobering, but I rest when I need to rest. I use Trazodone to battle my cancer insomnia. I get up to write poetry, to garden, and to spend time with my mother, children, and grandchildren. One of my greatest lifelines is talking weekly or sometimes more to my brother Will on FaceTime. He lives in New Zealand. Later, when I was out of the woods he told me, \"Glenis I really thought you were gonna die.\" I appreciated him showing up. We joked a lot. We tried to right the world. I am thankful for my family and my community, which cares for and about me. However, some days, I still feel lost in the wilderness of cancer. Somedays, I feel broken and withered, but I do my best to make meaning and strive to find purpose. I remind myself now is all there is. I remember to breathe in fully. Remember to enjoy all the growing things around me, including me. Know that there is rugged terrain in the wilderness, but there is also beauty. Remind myself that I am here to claim my space and in my Glenis-way--Bloom Anyhow! I felt the Tacoma Fall chilled air as I walked alongside Renee buttoned in my favorite coat, the one with a faux fur collar and magnetic clasps as buttons. I struggled to match her long stride but we twinned with our plaited hair, when we entered her hush-filled home she did not warn me of her mama lying on the couch taking a nap, on her way somewhere from which she would not return. Every one of her bones pronounced, but I was not afraid; I felt the room hum around me like it did in chapel when the rays of light shone on me through stained-glass windows when she extended her skinny branch of an arm and circled me with her voice clear as the dome of sky outside \"Glenis, come here. Don't you know I love you?\" Me, a scruff of a muffin little girl what did I know of love? But her words made a solid landing. I think it was about the place she was going. I think it was about those three words. Every Autumn, I think of Mrs. Langley when the leaves turn golden, rust, and ruby and begin their dancing descent, I can feel her brightness upon me especially now on my cancer journey. I remember the gift she gave me and now I too, never hesitate to say to anyone in need, I love you. About the Author Glenis Redmond is the First Poet Laureate of Greenville, South Carolina.

    "data": "An Interview with Paul Kandarian, Actor, Writer, Activist: By Val Walker Introduction This year the Health Story Collaborative, in partnership with COAAST (Creating Outreach About Addiction Support Together), launched performances of an autobiographical play written by Paul Kandarian and his son, Paul, calledResurfacing. Their story takes a close look at how addiction tears apart family relationships as well as how our wider community can play a vital role in bringing a family back together in the fragile, early stages of recovery. Last April, I sat in the audience of this play alongside an audience of over 100 people who broke into a standing ovation as we wiped away our tears of relief and hope. I felt the power of a live theatrical performance telling a true story with a very hard-won and inspiring ending. Resurfacingtells the story of Paul as a father who was once painfully disconnected and powerless over his son's opioid addiction. And worse, he believed he was responsible for his son's pain. \"I felt like a shitty parent that my kid had turned out this way.\" The shame Paul suffered, alongside his son's shame of being addicted, became a vicious isolating force that polarized one from another. But despite the limitations of his family to heal from this isolating force, and the alienation of returning from Afghanistan as a veteran, his son turns to supportive people in his community to help him build his recovery support network. The healing force of the wider community is also what Paul needs as a father to break through his isolation and shame. In short,Resurfacingshows us how our community can hold families together through isolating times when they have no one to count on. We need our communities to grapple with addiction and the long, lonely path of recovery. About Paul Paul E. Kandarian is an actor and a writer living in the Boston-Providence area. He has written countless articles for a variety of publications, including theBoston Globe,Yankeemagazine,Rhode Island Monthly,Boston Parent,Seattle's Childand many others. Since 2007 he has dedicated his creative talents towards acting by appearing in independent films, TV commercials, educational videos and more. But with all the acting he does, the most important work he does is performing with the nonprofit, COAAST, Creating Outreach about Addiction Support Together. A Rhode Island-based nonprofit devoted to eradicating the opioid epidemic through arts-based therapeutic and community-driven approaches, COAAST was founded by Ana Bess Moyer Bell. Working closely with Ana Bess, Paul performs in the COAAST production ofFour Legs to Stand Onin addition toResurfacingin his mission as an activist in helping communities heal from addiction. Theater as a Gathering Force to Build Community Paul Kandarian with Ryan Durkay inResurfacing(Photo: Boston College The Heights) Paul was the perfect person to explore the role theater plays in strengthening our communities to grapple with addiction. I couldn't wait to ask Paul about his experiences performing for diverse audiences sinceResurfacingwas launched earlier this year. Val:Paul, how does repeatedly performing in a play about your own painful ordeal make you feel? It must be exhausting, to say the least, if not difficult. Paul.Sure--It does feel nerve-wracking at times, and it does hit close to home. Yes, it's raw, and you \"put yourself out there,\" and you do \"go there\" time and time again. But seriously, it'snecessary. That's why I do this. This story needs to be told and it comes straight from the heart, which I think is the best way to get it out there. My words and my son's words speak for thousands of fathers and sons going through addiction and recovery. I am honored to be performing, and I will say again why I am performing as an activist: \"We hurt as a community, so we must heal as a community.\" Val: How does theater make us all feel part of our community? Paul:Theater works on many levels to make us feel a part of our community. First of all, theater validates that we alreadyarea community. When we all get together in a big room to watch a true story being told, we are assured that community is truly around us--we just don't see it until we are all in that room together. Theater shows us what has been there behind the scenes, that our community is in action, long before it has turned into a news event or a script or a play. Just think about it: When you go to a play about something you care about, you are surrounded by a bunch of people you don't know (strangers) and yet we've all come together to be moved by the same things (addiction, loneliness, isolation, families in chaos) and we all have a common experience at the same time--now,that'scommunity. We forget we are part of a community because most of the time we are running around in our individualized little bubbles. It's like the saying, \"A fish doesn't know it's wet.\" We hardly remember we are all in this big shitstorm together as human communities. Val. I never thought of community in that way--that we just forget that we alreadyarea community until we are all in that room together having the same experience. Grappling with addiction, recovery and isolation does require this powerful sense of community that supports us. And furthermore, how does theater create community? Paul:Theater has an immersive force. It pulls us in. That immersion is healing because we are somehow given the permission to tap what is uncomfortable inside us. Theater allows us to \"go there\" to what's eating at us, what's downright painful. When we identify with a character, we sort of hitch a ride with that person to go through their journey and come out with something they have learned. Essentially theater works on the assumption that if you can feel it, you can heal it.Best of all, theater can take us to the stigmatized, or shameful parts of ourselves. The parts we hide from others as well as ourselves. We might even feel acceptance and compassion for those hidden parts. Paul E. Kandarian, (far left) son Paul S. Kandarian, (second from left) Anna Bess Moyer Bell (holding mic), Founder, and other COAAST performers. (Photo courtesy of COAAST) Val.Yes, the stigmatized and shameful place that the opioid epidemic touches in all of us... Paul.To make a point about stigma, I often try a live experiment with our audiences who come to seeResurfacing. Here is what I do: I ask the people in the audience to raise their hands if they know someone who has cancer, and most people will raise their hands. But when I ask people to raise their hands if they know someone with an addiction, far fewer hands will go up. The audience \"gets it\" when we do this experiment. We hide so much. Still, theater has a way of reaching the parts we hide, and this helps remove the stigma. And I have one more thing to say about why theater is so healing. It is revelatory. It shows us we are more similar than we are different. It reveals we are mostly alike deep inside. I find that very hopeful. Theater helps us feel that this world does not have to be so impersonal and dehumanizing. We are, indeed, much more alike than our world seems to tell us. Social media, for example, can tell us how special or different or unique or better or worse we are from one another. I believe theater does the opposite. We show up and we feel the same feeling at the same time in the same place. Theater gathers us together and breaks us out of isolation and loneliness. Paul Kandarian's son, Paul S. Kandarian Val.Paul, of all the shows you have performed withResurfacing, which one has been the most memorable for you? Paul: Earlier this fall, we performed at the Providence VA Medical Center. It was a packed house, a great turnout. It felt so good to perform for so many veterans. My son, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, was in that audience. Sitting in that audience was also the clinician that he first reached out to and trusted, Lynne Deion. Lynne never gave up on him and has been there throughout his recovery. It was brilliant to have them all there. It was cathartic, to say the least. I am so proud of my son. He has now completed his degree in psychology and is working as a rehabilitation counselor with others in recovery. I'm looking forward to more performances ofResurfacingin 2020. In partnership with the Health Story Collaborative, COAAST will be expandingResurfacingto more venues, especially for veterans in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Stay tuned. What a long, long journey it has been for all of us. It's hard work, but being an activist as an actor is the most rewarding thing I've ever done in my life. I never thought helping others could feel this good. Val.Thanks for all you do, Paul. Congratulations for launchingResurfacingthis year. It's been wonderful to talk with you. Paul.I've enjoyed it.

    "data": "Robert Burns Carolyne slumped back in her wheelchair. \"I'm shitty,\" she said. Carolyne is 85 years old, and has lived in a memory care facility for almost a year. Over half of her time in the fifteen-person unit has been spent in quarantine; family visits have been stopped by state order five months ago. I'm a geriatrician, and the only outside person to have visited her during the isolation. Her days are limited to contacts with the nurses and aides, supplemented by face time contacts with her daughter. The note from the nurse that morning told me Carolyne had lost weight; she was down nearly thirty pounds over four months. I asked her about her appetite and food preferences. Like many older adults in assisted living, she dismissed it with a wave of her hand. The kitchen had been making her personal meals, trying to prepare her foods that she will eat. It was not been successful. I told her that she had lost weight. \"I'll fit in the casket better,\" she said. She smiled. I explored her comments, probing for depression, thoughts of self-harm. She has dementia and several other chronic illnesses. I concluded she is exhausted from her isolation. In Tennessee, where I live, and all across the country, older adults are locked in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The precautions are prudent. To date there have been over 170,000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States. According to the CDC, 8 in 10 of US deaths have been in people 65 years and older. I've worked in nursing homes during the pandemic. In a couple of them the virus spread like fire in a dry forest, killing dozens, and infecting staff and other residents. Walking through a nursing home with a COVID outbreak was a surreal experience; masks and gowns and distancing from the staff and patients made physical contact, human touch, with those who needed it most impossible. Being in an infected nursing home during the initial dark days of the pandemic, while we were all gathering our footing, was an apocalyptic hell I would not wish on anyone. Several months ago, I had a visit with Marjorie, a 75-year-old woman in one of those infected facilities. She had dementia and strokes, and had become infected with the virus. She had stopped eating. She was more confused, and interacted less. It was clear she needed to be on hospice care. I called her sister to discuss her situation. Because of the lockdown they had not seen each other for almost two months. For ten minutes I held my phone so the two of them could Face Time, the first time the two of them had seen each other since the quarantine. Marjorie talked to her sister over the small screen. They both said \"I love you.\" Marjorie was more interactive with her sister than she had been with me, and I told her sister. \"Family is medicine,\" her sister said as she wiped tears off her cheek. Carolyne needs her family. I agree isolation was the right decision when the pandemic was exploding in spring and early summer. I've worn masks since April and have been tested for COVID nine times to make sure I don't infect my patient. But in my experience, all isolated older adults, especially in facilities, need family contact. Reuniting with family members in assisted living and nursing homes is at the intersection of facts, science, and policy. I write this in a state that has not mandated masks and struggles with getting the virus under control. But I believe there is a way to move forward, at least for now. I am confident that if family members were isolated before visits, wore masks and socially distanced during their visit, families could have brief encounters together. The risk of spread with a brief hug or touch is minimal, with the above precautions. There is no medicine which will make Carolyne eat or improve her mood. She needs to see her daughter. Note: Patient names have been changed.",

Brook seemed to be developing normally and reaching all of her milestones -- learning how to sit up and roll over, grasping at toys-until she was 6 months of age, at which point she started to regress. She lost skills she had already learned, and gradually, Kate noticed other things. Brook didn't seem to respond to her name, she would fixate on lights and just stare and stare, she started dropping toys, unable to hold onto them. Eventually, after a long medical work up, Brook was diagnosed with Tay Sachs disease in 2012, and Kate was told that her daughter would most likely not live past her fourth birthday. Today, Brook, is three years old and requires constant care. She is blind. She cannot swallow and is fed through a feeding tube. She is having near constant seizures. And she continues to deteriorate. Brook's older brother Jake, born to a different father and now 9 years old does not suffer from the disorder. Listen above to Kate's story of living with and caring for her terminally ill daughter. Tay Sachs is a fatal genetic disorder. A child is born with Tay Sachs when he or she inherits two damaged copies of the HEXA gene on chromosome 15 (one from each parent), which results in a deficiency of the Hexosaminidase A enzyme and the subsequent build up of a damaging fatty substance in brain cells. The result is a relentess, progressive loss of physical and mental functioning and eventually, death. A person with one damaged gene and one normal gene will become a carrier with no clinical symptoms of the disease. If two carriers have children together, there is a 25% chance of giving birth to an affected child with each pregnancy. Tay Sachs, a rare disease with an incidence of approximately 1 in 320,000 in the general population, occurs with increased frequency in certain populations, including Ashkenazi Jews, French Canadians, and Cajuns (from Louisiana). In these groups, approximately 1 in 30 individuals is a carrier, and 1 in 3,500 children will be born with the disease. Kate, who is of French Canadian descent, had no idea she was a carrier before Brook's diagnosis. She knew nothing about Tay Sachs, and was unaware that French Canadians are at increased risk. Though pre-conception counseling is available, Kate didn't know this at the time, and if she had, she might have assumed that it wasn't relevant to her. How does a mother manage life when her child is dying? She mothers. Kate spends most of every day in her living room with Brook, an oxygen machine hissing in the background, surrounded by pill bottles, suctioning her daughter's secretions, moistening her lips, and giving her medication to temper her seizures. Kate's primary goal is to keep Brook as comfortable as possible in her last days, and she works very hard to achieve this. \"So many people for so long would say, 'You're so amazing, I don't know how you do this; This is incredible, how do you manage this,'\" Kate says \"I would look at them and think, 'This is my daughter, how can I not do this?'\" And every day she tries to spend as much time as possible with her older son, Jake, and to support him through the loss of his sister the best she can.

    "data": "Some of the most impactful people encountered in our recovery journeys are our treatment providers. They provide invaluable education, compassion, faith in our capacity to heal, accountability, and the best of them help us relearn how to trust. I met Kim Wyman, the dietician at Monte Nido Vista, my first night of residential treatment. It was a Monday, the day every week when those furthest along in recovery prepare dinner for the whole house. To bless the beautiful meal they prepared and to cultivate a positive mindset before eating what for some of us was quite a challenge, Kim sang \"Amazing Grace.\" Her heavenly voice, glowing presence, and palpable joy for sharing this food in community brought me to tears. Though we only worked together for ten weeks, Kim's wisdom resounds in my head to this day, guiding me to stick to recovery's course and reminding me of the healthy ways to meet my needs. In this podcast, she shares some of her perspectives on the process of healing from an eating disorder. How we feed ourselves is an expression of how we feel about ourselves. Sometimes the most effective way to change how we feel about ourselves is to change how we feed ourselves. Kim considers Recovery to be a process of Recovering Self. She elucidates the different parts of Self that need to be actively, compassionately cared for, and explains how one must separate physical needs from emotional needs (to be seen, heard, witnessed, and acknowledged) in order to meet them all appropriately. Activating sensory experience is one of Kim's hallmark methods for recovery. She encourages people to get out of their heads and into their bodies by seeking pleasure, enjoying nature, and cultivating a loving relationship with food through the creative act of cooking, truly tasting food, and eating with others. Kim explains the 3 tenets of recovery - never weigh yourself, journal, and reach out to others - and also offers advice about how to find the best dietician for you. In addition to being a Registered Dietician, Kim holds a Master's in Public Health. She has been working primarily with men and women who struggle with eating disorders since 1997.",

    "data": "It is really scary having a disease that even medical providers do not know exists. A Day in the Life with GP It is 1:30 in the morning. The monster that dwells within my stomach wakes me from another nightmare. As I sit up, the intense nausea practically brings me to my knees. I am dry heaving. Some people compare this to having the flu. In my experience, gastroparesis (GP) makes having the flu look like a walk in the park. What I am going through is worse than any hangover I have ever had or the time I got food poisoning. I take a Zofran for the nausea, and I relocate to the recliner so I can sit up. The minutes seem like hours. Time passes by so slowly. It is now 4:30 a.m. I have been sitting in the chair unable to go back to sleep. I am having anxiety. The stress this sickness causes is indescribable. I am also very depressed. At times I have thought about suicide, but so far I have not acted on those thoughts. When I am in a flare (that is when my symptoms are worse than usual,) I become very scared and confused. My mother calls it crossing over to the dark side. My thinking is negative and irrational. I want to die. The psychological aspects of this disease are almost as bad as the physical, and they do feed off each other. Even though I see a therapist and take an antidepressant, my mind has turned into my own worst enemy thanks to GP. Whenever I can sleep, GP haunts me in my dreams. I never really can escape. It is relentless, and I suffer 24/7/365. It's around 5:30 a.m., and the worst part of the sickness is starting to pass. As my old Dell Desktop is booting up, I have to go to the bathroom. I praise God the laxatives have worked. When I first got sick I suffered from chronic diarrhea. It was so bad I spent a good portion of my time on the pot. I have had my share of accidents in the bed and in my pants. That has to be one of the most demeaning feelings I have ever experienced in my life. I don't have to worry about that anymore, though, because with all the medications I take, I now suffer from the opposite problem. Sometimes I go for days without going. When I finally do have a bowel movement, it is extremely painful. I am usually impacted and the feces must be digitally removed, which makes me bleed from my rectum. That entire experience is physically and emotionally brutal. Who knew a simple bodily function could be such a traumatic ordeal? It just took everything I had in me to feed my cats. I feel bad for my pets. I can hardly care for them anymore. My mother usually has to remind me to feed them. I never talk to them or play with them nowadays. I just don't feel well enough to participate in those types of activities anymore. Those are the kind of things I used to love. GP has truly touched every area of my life. I am weak and shaking. I can hardly think straight as I sit down at my computer. I am so cold. For some reason I am always so cold. I turn on the heating pad and pile the blankets up over me. I live in Arizona, where it is over seventy degrees outside right now, and I am still freezing! I can't even begin to imagine living in a cold weather climate with a diagnosis of GP. Shivering, I log onto Facebook. Last April I took a turn for the worse and ended up with a flare that lasted months. I was so sick I could not leave the house. All I could do was sit at the computer. I ended up meeting other people online just like me, who also suffer from GP. That is one of the only good things I have gotten from this horrid disease. I have made many great friends that mean the world to me, even though I have never met them personally. I also found many support groups where these same people shared their experience, strength, and hope with me. I have read GP only affects about 5 million people, and the medical community does not know much about it. In fact, the ER staff had to Google search \"gastroparesis\" upon my last admit. They had never heard of it. Neither had I before I got the diagnosis. It is really scary having a disease that even medical providers do not know exists. My regular GI doctor has only had three people in his entire career with GP. His other two patients are diabetic. I am the only person he has ever treated who is \"idiopathic\" (which means they do not know what caused the GP). So, the GP community on Facebook has taught me more about this disease than any doctor has - and more than what I have been able to read about on the Internet. Facebook is also how I socialize. Since I am always sick, many of my \"friends\" no longer have anything to do with me. It is hard to make plans to go out when I never know how I am going to feel. Half the time I end up having to cancel. I have all but given up hope of ever finding a potential mate who will accept me being sick. I have no sex life at all. I am so very lonely. However, I am fortunate to have my family by my side. I had to go home to live at my parents' house about a year ago because my symptoms became so bad I could no longer work. I ended up losing my apartment and everything in it. I filed for disability and got denied. I have appealed that decision. Who knows how long it will take before I am approved? In the meantime, I am flat broke, and I am on public assistance. Twice in the last few months they have told me my medical insurance has been cut off. Both times were apparent mistakes, but do you know how upsetting that was? I have never been so afraid in my life. I really wish I could work and be self-supporting; relying on the government is really unreliable. Okay, I have taken my morning meds, and I ate breakfast. My breakfast is the same every day: one Activia yogurt. Since I got diagnosed, I have been on the GP friendly diet. I can no longer eat the things I love. The diet is very restrictive. Following the diet has helped decrease the violent vomiting, but I have developed a fear of food. To be honest, I only have about 10 different \"safe foods.\" Since I am always sick, I don't really consider them \"safe foods.\" At any rate, I am terrified of eating anything new or different outside of those 10 things. I have lost a little over 80 pounds since I have been diagnosed with GP. I do not go out to eat at restaurants anymore. When I first got sick, just looking at all the food on the menu and seeing what the other customers were eating was more than I could take. The smells of all of that food made me even more nauseated. I hate getting sick in public so I just don't dine out. Even watching television is rough. All those commercials with all that yummy food I can't have really messes with me sometimes. Then there are the holidays! I usually become very depressed during what is supposed to be a happy time. In America, our holidays are all centered on food. Hell, I can't even have cake on my birthday anymore. The last time I did that, I wound up in the emergency room. It is really tough, but at least I can still eat. Many people with GP rely on tube feeds and TPN for their nutrition. I struggle with maintaining my weight, malnutrition, and dehydration on a continual basis. It is now about 9:00 in the morning. My 70 year old caregiver is awake. My mom has become my caregiver. It makes me feel so bad knowing that I should be the one taking care of her. I also wonder what will happen to me when something happens to her. Right now, I do not have the finances or physical and mental well-being to take care of myself. My future does not look too bright, does it? In the meantime, watching me get sicker and sicker is killing my family. My four year old grandson does not understand why I can't play with him for more than a few minutes at a time. That kills me. Now it is time to get dressed. I mostly wear baggy sweat pants as I can't stand to have anything restrictive around my tummy. It takes all of my energy to stand in the shower. I did not shave my legs all winter long. I only wear makeup on special occasions, which is pretty much never anymore. I have not had my hair done in about two years. I was a real girly-girl before I got sick. I was never without hair and makeup. I always wore a dress and high heels. GP has robbed me of my femininity, my sexuality, and my self esteem. From about 3:00 in the afternoon until I go to bed is usually the best time of day for me. On a good day, I will usually try to do something around the house. It has become increasingly challenging to clean and do my laundry. This is also the time of day when I try to arrange my doctor's appointments. I am too sick to go in mornings. Can you imagine being too sick to go to the doctor? Can you imagine the doctor's office being the only place you ever really go? Now it is dinner time. Just recently, I had to go to liquids only for dinner. It is so hard to watch everyone else eat a burger and fries while I get broth or a nutritional shake. After dinner I try to walk around the block. Remember, I have little energy, but I do believe this little bit of activity helps with motility. I watch television for the remainder of my day. It is now about 8:00 in the evening. I take my laxative and hope for gentle overnight relief. I fill up my pill cups for the next day. I take so many different medications now that I have to place them in cups, so I can keep track of whether I have taken them or not. I have forgotten to take them, or have taken too many on occasion, and this has led to problems. There are very few medications available to treat GP. When I first got diagnosed, I was on Reglan. That medicine has a black box warning. I started having side effects that are now permanent. Now I take Domperidone. It also has serious potential side effects, and I have to get regular EKGs. Dom is not approved for use in the United States. I have to order it online from Canada. It takes about ten to thirty days to receive. One of my biggest fears is that I will not receive my medication on time. I get very sick within a day of not taking the medication. I also fear the day it stops working. Currently, I am seeing a motility specialist at Mayo Clinic. There are not many treatment options available for me. I am going to start alternative therapies. I see a chiropractor next week and I hope to see an acupuncturist and Chinese herbal medicine doctor in the near future. I am also going to be checking into Botox injections and a Medtronic stimulator. As I mentioned, I have no money, and I do not think my insurance will cover those procedures, but I am still going to look into it. At this point, I am desperate to feel better, and I am willing to try just about anything. I go to bed at around 9:00 p.m. This is when I pray. My faith in God is what gets me through the hell I endure every day. So, I hope and pray for a good night's rest without nightmares. Then the monster that dwells within wakes me about one o'clock in the morning to rear its ugly head again...",

    "data": "Born with a benign tumor (or \"hemangioma\") on my left cheek, I attracted a great amount of uncomfortable attention. This attention influenced the way in which I saw myself. I often felt that my blemish prevented me from being what society considered \"beautiful.\" As a girl entering her teenage years, I could not help but worry about the ways I would be viewed by others, especially by boys. When I expressed these concerns to my mom, she offered a potential solution that would require no words - a stern stare back would do the trick. I would simply be giving others a taste of their own medicine. While my voice was hushed in hopes of diverting attention away, it quickly became apparent that even this solution would not work. My work illustrates this struggle and my resulting frustration as I felt that I had no control over how people looked at me. On the contrary, it began to feel like others had more control than I did over how I perceived myself. My comic was inspired by Miriam Engelberg's graphic narrative,Cancer Made Me a Shallower Person, in hopes of showing rather than telling my experience with staring. My piece ends with my unsatisfied self confronting the reality of living with an abnormal mark on my face. It is difficult to change the way society views people who possess different characteristics. Such a societal approach has the power to negatively impact the illness experience of many individuals living with various disabilities, disorders, and diseases. As I matured throughout my experiences, however, I came to learn that a greater triumph can result in the way I react - by not letting the stares of others reflect onto the person I saw in the mirror. With this perspective I became a more confident individual who appreciates the differences that other people possess.

    "data": "By Charissa Rigano Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is partly caused by genes you inherit from your parents, and partly by outside factors that may trigger the condition. Experts assert that MS is not directly inherited, but it is agreed that the condition is more likely in people who are related to someone who has it -- for example, the chance of a sibling or child of someone with MS also developing it is estimated by the National Health Service to be around 2 or 3 in 100. I am not sure what this really means...but here's my story. 1995 Returned home from my honeymoon. Loss of feeling in my right hand and arm. Checked into George Washington Hospital being treated by a neurologist. FAMILY HISTORY. MRI. Lumbar puncture. Steroids. US Open tennis on TV. I know what the doctors are going to say since my father Richard Rigano (1940-1992) died in a nursing home in Massachusetts from MS in 1992 before he ever met my now husband. I was Daddy's little girl who had lived my life watching my father ravaged by this un-curable disease -- how do I handle the same diagnosis? I chose to mostly ignore the MS diagnosis and continue to live my life. Continued to see my neurologist every 6 months. Took 'MS' medication when we could get the insurance company to cover the cost. Although these medications are FDA-approved, for all intents and purposes they are being tested on MS patients. I say this becausenothingcures the disease, and each patient is so different (with symptoms and disease progression) that there is no one drug that has been shown to change the disease progression. In retrospect, I am forever grateful to the doctors who encouraged me to try these medications as my healthmayhave been dramatically different if I had resisted the pharmaceuticals. Life moves on. 2000 First child, a daughter born February. 2005 Adopted second daughter, born December 2003. Busy raising children and loving my family. 2008 Completed sprint triathlon (0.5 mile swim, 20k bike, and 5k run) to celebrate my 40th birthday. 2018 Major life changes including: oldest daughter graduated from high school and left for college, and death of my chosen mother figure - the mother of my heart - by suicide. In hindsight, I realize that these stressful life changes including losing my best friend affected my health. Noticed issues walking, including left foot drop and inability to walk as far as I could in the past. Tried many different things. Changed my diet including eliminating inflammatory foods (dairy and gluten). After many unsuccessful physical therapists (PT), I realized that patients with MS need a knowledgeable PT, and I found an amazing MS-specific PT. I can no longer ignore my MS, as it is affecting my life. I must take action. My neurologist spoke of my disease as 'secondary progressive' during my next appointment. I looked him straight in the eye and said, \"If you ever say that again I will walk out and never return.\" A bit dramatic, but I am Sicilian, and visions of my father flooded my memory at the use of 'progressive' because SPMS (secondary progressive MS) is what my father had that caused him to end up in a nursing home begging us to end his life. It is a type of MS that comes after relapsing remitting MS, and your disability gets worse and worse without periods of remission. When my doctor suggested that my disease was moving to SPMS, memories of my father and his final days paralyzed in the nursing home bed, begging us to end it all, came flooding back. After reconnecting with a friend from high school who also has MS, I learned about her experience with Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant(HSCT) which halted her MS. After doing my own research, I went to Puebla Mexico and had HSCT in December 2020. My friend from high school, let's call her Kristen, is a very kind person who always told me of the fond memories she had of my father. Although we fell out of touch after touch after high school, I knew that she had MS. For years I toyed with the idea of contacting her, but never did. When my physical condition deteriorated, I finally got the guts to call her and she shared her journey with me. 2022 I remember what life with my chronically ill father was like, and how he spent his last days in a nursing home begging for us to end his life. This experience was neither good nor bad, just how life unfolded. It drives me to never stop loving and taking care of myself, even when I am exhausted. I am now 19 months post-HSCT, and although I have lingering doubts at times about the effectiveness of the treatment and my health -- like when I caught Covid-19 after 2.5 years of avoiding it, and getting Lyme after a tick bite -- I remember that I am human and have to be cautious and patient when I get sick. Biggest findings from this time: Recovery from HSCT is no joke. I must manage my stress and my diet. I have to keep my body moving(\"if you don't use it you'll lose it\"). Living with a chronic illness includes being flexible. Be thankful for my friends. I believe that I have halted the progression of MS, but I continue to live with pre-HSCT myelin damage. My current mission is believing that I can do whatever I put my mind to, and am not limited by doubts and chronic illness. How do I manage my chronic illness? By having a positive attitude, moving my body every day, and not letting fear win. I am constantly working on getting over my fear of entering new situations, but hope that as I progress on my journey this will get more natural and easier.

    "data": "Before it all began, we were just regular people, living our quiet life and growing into a marriage. I often shake my head in disbelief that something as dramatic as a brain tumor happened to such a boring couple. You see, we met in a hotbed of nerd-dom, MIT, in a graduate program for organic chemistry. I had come from a small college and felt behind academically, and most of my peers had come with serious relationships while I knew nobody. As I struggled to find my way, I noticed Chris. He exuded calm and kindness in a competitive, charged environment. After a helpful prod from a mutual friend, I summoned the nerve to ask Chris out for a visit to the Harvard Museum of Natural History on our day off from lab. He accepted and asked me to lunch the day before our date. He surprised me by being funny and talkative, and we hit it off. Our time at the museum was almost magical. As it was about to close, Chris and I entered the Earth and Planetary Science room full of minerals and rocks. It was dark outside and the display cases of gems seemed to shine brightly in contrast, and I was also shining with happiness. We extended our time together with dinner, then again with coffee. I felt lucky. We bonded quickly over our shared interests in organic chemistry, teaching, and family. Unlike most of our peers, Chris had a rich life outside of school, full of family and friends. Rapidly our separate worlds became entwined. We were a team: best friends, partners, each the biggest supporter of the other. He did not ask me to marry him, we decided together. He did not surprise me with a ring, we chose one together. We turned to each other to debrief about work, to discuss our worries, to make plans. We didn't need much outside of our private world. In 2007, we were three years into our marriage and everything was just taking off. I landed my first \"real\" job, we bought our house, we had our first child, and we turned 30. On the last day of 2007, everything turned upside down never to quite right itself again. We were in the Midwest visiting my family, headed to a New Year's Eve gathering. Chris, luckily not driving, began acting strangely. It was the shock of my life to see my husband unresponsive and in uncontrolled motion, experiencing what I would later learn was a grand mal seizure. I fished Chris's cell phone out of his pocket and called 911 in a panic. At the hospital, Chris was given anti-seizure medications and sent straight off for a CT scan. Soon after, a clearly experienced doctor broke the news - the seizure was caused by a mass in Chris's brain. In my shock, the only thing I could ask was, \"is it big?\" The answer was not encouraging; it was \"fairly good-sized.\" Time seemed to unfurl differently after that. Moments blended together in a haze of shock. We flew back to Boston, Chris slept on the plane with our son napping across our laps. My mind was buzzing with white noise, there was only one thought that stood out with clarity - what is going to happen? There would be no quick answer to that... January was a dark, confusing time as we chased all over the Boston area in search of the right medical team. Finally, we landed at MGH. Chris had an aggressive, awake craniotomy on one of the longest days of my life. The rest of the year was a dark blur of a difficult recovery from the surgery, daily radiation treatments, cognitive rehab appointments and a terrifying uncertainty. We also had a perplexing diagnosis for Chris - low grade glioma. The doctors were absolutely clear: there is no cure, the tumor would come back and be more aggressive, but the prognosis was that Chris would likely live for 10-20 years. At first the disease surveillance scans were frequent. Gradually the time between them lengthened as they came back stable. As partners, our shock turned to coping with a long-term disease. We took things one day at a time, waking up, readying our son for daycare, working. When one of us had a particularly bad day, we learned to get through it by staying in motion. Vigorous house-cleaning, raking the yard, cooking on the grill - these things provided helpful distractions. Through it all we had each other. We talked about everything as we always had, but we became even closer. Slowly, our life did return to something resembling normal, but the undercurrent of wondering when the tumor would return was always there. After a couple of years, the tumor began to feel surreal and we discussed this endlessly. How could life feel this normal? Did anyone else understand that we were waiting for the other shoe to drop? There were no days that Chris did not think about dying and no days without the incurable tumor crossing my mind, but there was still work to do, our son to raise, dinner to fix, and bills to pay. This long-term, terminal diagnosis threw a wrench in our family plans. If we hadn't already had a child, perhaps we would not have chosen to bring children into the situation to avoid the future pain of loss. But, our son was already on this path with us and we had always wanted to have more than one child. We interrogated the doctors about genetics and felt assured that the kids' risk would not be higher. We \"just\" had to reconcile the idea of a new baby with a terminal brain tumor... Over time, \"no\" gradually turned to \"yes\" for Chris, and neither of us looked back. Our second pregnancy brought a sweet joy. The brain tumor gave us a deep appreciation for this chance at new life. Our son was thrilled when he learned he would be a big brother! One day in the middle of a science seminar, I looked down and smiled at my black and white patterned shirt wiggling in time to the first palpable baby kicks. The day we found out the baby was a little girl, Chris and I were both overjoyed and marveled at our great luck to parent a girl along with our boy. Just before she made her entrance to the world, Chris and I slowly walked the hallways of the hospital, pausing frequently for contractions, Chris supporting me as he always did. Despite the pain, I remember thinking how improbable this moment was in light of his illness, and trying to etch it in my memory. As she was born, Chris played his favorite song The One Who Knows and we both shed happy tears. We delighted in this little girl, knowing that nothing about life was guaranteed and still, here she was somehow. As our family expanded to four, the richness of life also expanded. Chris reveled in being a dad - he was funny, always able to diffuse difficult moments with a joke. He was kind, quick to enfold his children in hugs. Chris grew professionally, becoming a leader at work. For several years life was a beautiful, normal dance of \"do you need to leave early this morning, I'll pick the kids up tonight, can you grab some milk on the way home, do we have plans this weekend, let's go out for pizza.\" That is, until the tumor came back. It's interesting, when I anticipated the recurrence, I always thought it would be instantly devastating. Instead, we found that recurrence was gradual but progressive. It happened like this: Chris experienced a slight uptick in focal seizures in the months leading up to his annual MRI. Instead of the usual \"looks good\" post-appointment text, I received one that just read \"appointment over.\" Chris reported that there was an area of concern that could be tumor growth. A biopsy revealed Grade 3 tumor, more aggressive than before, but still, Chris was himself. We were lucky in that respect. He entered a clinical trial and chased all over Boston for special MRI scans and long hospital days, all the while keeping fastidious track of cycle days, medications, and symptoms. We were worried, but we were doing something about the tumor. Things went smoothly, until the awful day Chris's clinical trial doctor popped her head in the exam room to exclaim that his tumor had shrunk by 30%, but soon came back to say no, sorry, there was a mistake in the software measurements. The tumor had actually grown so much Chris was ineligible for the clinical trial. After four months of normal time on Temodar treatment and a stable MRI, Chris had a grand mal seizure once again. The dread of the next MRI scan was sickening, and it brought worse news than we imagined - not only was the tumor growing but it was also infiltrating a second area. Another biopsy revealed that the tumor had progressed to glioblastoma. But still, Chris was himself, working on his laptop not 48 hours past brain surgery. But then, Chris declined suddenly. He began having lengthy focal seizures, his vision deteriorated, and reading was problematic. He went on emergency radiation treatments and last resort Avastin infusions. After a whirlwind of daily hospital trips, we had to wait and watch how the tumor responded. We were on borrowed time. We did unpleasant things: estate planning, transitioning all of the bills to me. Chris showed me where the water shutoff to the house was and where to find manuals for the lawnmower and snowblower. Those discussions about how to carry on without him were excruciating. Chris's main concern was that the family would be taken care of, and in light of the painful fact that he would soon die, he did everything he could to ensure it. Most importantly, we tried to be present for each other and the kids. We noted how difficult it was to \"live in the moment\" for an extended period of time, but we tried. We enjoyed simple moments, knowing that there would not be many left: walks together, date lunches, family outings, time at the park, beach trips. Chris did not feel the urge to check off an ambitious bucket list, but rather he treasured the kind of togetherness that can be so easily taken for granted. All the while, we braced for the worst. For a few months, it didn't come and we started to muse over the fact that it had not happened. Summer turned to fall before the tumor grew, but still Chris did relatively well even after we received this news. Our hearts were full and breaking as we fit in lots of lasts - last Halloween, Chris's 41st birthday, trip to the Midwest to see family, Thanksgiving. As the holidays approached we knew that if Chris made it to them, they would be the last as a family of four. As we were preparing to leave the house to pick out a Christmas tree, Chris had a grand mal seizure. Just as he came out of it, another started. I did my best to stay calm and administer medication, but then a third seizure started. He was taken by ambulance to the ER and almost died from respiratory depression. Somehow, Chris made it through. We were lucky. We had not been ready to say goodbye despite all of our preparation. Chris came home by ambulance on hospice services. It was a terribly difficult December as his right side weakened, seizure activity increased, the number of medications was overwhelming, and the end was drawing close. We set small goals, trying to make it through Christmas and have a nice family time. Somehow we did, but afterwards Chris was less peaceful and I could no longer care for him well. In our past discussions about this end stage we had always prioritized Chris being at home but realized things could get out of hand and a hospice facility might be needed. Chris had wanted to shield his children from the worst of his decline. The moment arrived when he felt he should not be at home and I agreed. On yet another difficult New Year's Eve, we got word mid-morning that a bed opened at a hospice house, and Chris left our home by ambulance, just a couple of hours later. To say it was hard to watch him leave doesn't begin to touch the emptiness of that moment. As he was loaded into the ambulance, Chris lay on a gurney facing the front of the house we bought together and raised our family in. I often wonder what was going through his mind. Was he desperately sad? The kids and I had to watch him leave, knowing he would never return to us, and we cried together for a few minutes after he left. My solitary journey to the hospice house was marked by shock that this was actually happening. Despite my wanting time to stop, Chris faded over the next eight days. He was mostly peaceful, always loving, and truly serene in the end. When he could no longer speak, he telegraphed his love by winking his good eye slowly several times. Chris died on January 8th. Chris's brain tumor changed the course of his life and ended it early. It shaped mine, too, and that of our children, in ways that we are only just discovering. Telling this journey is something that helps me process everything. But, Chris was so much more than this terrible cancer. Before the tumor was discovered Chris already embodied gentleness, loved a good laugh, was whip smart, always kind, and steadfast in his love for family and friends. These things did not change in the face of terminal illness. If anything, Chris doubled down on the way he lived knowing his life would not be a long one. Now, Chris is gone and I'm no longer dreading his death but I'm desperately missing and loving him in his absence. I am left with a hundred thousand memories to carry as my life continues without my partner. I move forward reluctantly but still, I move forward. I am learning about myself and my capability as an individual. When things seem hard, I remember Chris's unwavering opinion that I could do it, whatever \"it\" was, and I remember how he managed so admirably under his impossible circumstances. On my better days I focus on the feeling of being lucky. I was lucky to know Chris, to learn from him, to love and be loved by him, and to share a life with him. I told Chris before and I will say it again now, in a heartbeat I would do everything all over again with him.

    "data": "By Dr. Annie Brewster and Leah Meyer More than a decade ago, Colleen Lum was diagnosed with Stage 3 ovarian cancer. Her children, Kyle and Kiara, were 11 and 8 years old at the time. A few months ago, after battling the disease for 13 years, Lum, who lives with her husband and family in Hopedale, Massachusetts, decided to end treatment. Today, at age 56, her health has further declined, according to her daughter. Lum is no longer eating or drinking much. And she's very, very tired. Through it all, though, she's been clear-eyed about her illness. \"We've always been straightforward and honest,\" Lum said during an extensive interview in June. The kids \"get the facts and the truth and it's not 'Mommy has a tummy ache.' No, 'Mommy has cancer.' \" Lum added: \"I was a good parent before cancer, but cancer made me a better parent, because you don't have time to postpone.\" Listen to Lum and her daughter Kiara share their stories here: Ovarian canceris an insidious disease, often asymptomatic until it is quite advanced, resulting in five-year survival rates of under 50 percent. Lum has beaten the odds and navigated an onslaught of difficult decisions with resilience and a keen sense of her priorities. \"You can talk about sex and drugs and alcohol with your kids because you don't have time to postpone those conversations,\" Lum said. \"Nobody's guaranteed tomorrow. And cancer makes that very relevant. When you can sit and talk to your children about your death, everything else becomes easy.\" Four years ago, Lum refused to participate in a clinical trial that would have required her to spend several months away from home and apart from her kids. When her physician implored her to enter the trial, saying it was his job to keep her alive, she replied, \"Well, it's my job to be a mother.\" Lum knows that she won't be around to see her 21-year-old daughter graduate from college -- and it's the thought of missing those major life events that saddens her most. \"It's not the dying that upsets me,\" she said. \"It's the milestones in your children's lives you're gonna miss. Seeing them walk down the aisle or seeing them have babies.\" Still, she's happy and proud she got to be a mother for so long. \"My miracle isn't that I walk out of here and I get cured. My miracle is that I got 13 years of a Stage 3C diagnosis and I watched an 8-year old and an 11-year old turn into a 21-year-old and a 24-year-old. The biggest thing here is perspective.\" After years of intrusive treatment, harsh side effects and approximately 160 rounds of chemotherapy, Lum knew in April that it was time to stop. Her body had had enough. To those who insist she must keep fighting, she said: \"So many people want to jump back into denial and pretend ... that this isn't happening. If you're coming along for the ride, you're getting in my boat, and my boat is reality.\" Now, with death approaching, Lum is grateful to know that not much has been left unsaid. And she spends time envisioning her death: I hope I die with grace and dignity, which I probably will, and a few swear words. It's one thing I've got as cancer's gone on -- I've maintained my filthy little mouth and my few favorite swear words. I wanna have the best quality of life for whatever days we have, and then it's like, I don't know what this whole dying stuff is gonna involve. I hope it's not painful, I hope it's peaceful. I hope I can die at home. But I don't know what it looks like. If I got to call the shots, I'd get to hang around in bed and talk to the very last frickin' minute. And kinda joke and go, 'Hey, it's time to go.' And I say goodbye, and I'd walk out peacefully. But as with cancer and most things, I don't know how much of a choice I get in that. Lum wants to go out on her terms. \"No ventilators or feeding tubes in this body,\" she said. While she accepts that she may not be able to control many things that happen at this point, she wants to control the things she can, and she has spelled it out clearly for her family. For instance: If she is in a coma, she says it's OK to send her to the hospital or hospice. She has chosen a casket, and wants it to be open. She's lined up a caterer for the reception. In our society we are notoriously bad attalking about death. It wasn't until this year that Medicare finally began reimbursing forend-of-life conversationsbetween patient and doctor. In one of the countless conversations Lum has had over the years, she imagines death as a continuation of life, but different: \"What if [it's] nothing but two little hills, and there's a bridge? And you're just leaving one world to go to another ... and it's really something very simple?\" Dr. Annie Brewster, a Boston internist and founder of the Health Story Collaborative, is a regular contributor to CommonHealth.

    "data": "By Michael Robin The narrative arc of my story is characterized by three acts but they are in reverse order - the ending, the transitional or healing stage, and new beginnings. My story begins with an abrupt ending to what had been the first sixty-three years of my life. On November 27, 2013, I made an attempt to end my life. For five intense months prior, the thought of suicide held me captive. A series of traumatic life events were what drove me to suicide. I had lost my job, income, and health insurance; I feared losing my professional therapy license and home; and my marriage was imploding. Isolated and cut off from the world, uncertain about who I was and why my life mattered, my ability to resist the temptation for oblivion faded rapidly. I couldn't, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, \"hold in balance the sense of futility of effort and the sense of the necessity to struggle.\" Living through a suicide attempt is a unique kind of bereavement. It wasaftermy suicide attempt that I learned that the feeling of suicidal despair is impermanent. The thought that my suffering would never end is what drove my suicidal behavior. Suspended in time and social space, my death was spiritual, not corporeal. As my old self was dying, my new self was struggling to be born. I identified with the writer Matthew Arnold who wrote, \"I was wandering between two worlds, one dead/the other powerless to be born.\" I had been in \"limbo\", crossing an extended threshold, where I entered as one person and came out another. My suicide attempt marked the turning point in my life. Recovering from a suicide attempt has not been simple or easy. I've had no self-help formula to rely on, nor have I been offered \"cheap grace.\" I write about the past to re-present my disparate emotions from a more enlightened present. With the passage of time, my perspective has changed and evolved many times over. Remembering and revising my story gives significance to my life. I no longer regret the past. What happened, happened. A life story can be revised, but not relived. In my writing, I seek transcendence, a sense of insight and awareness about what is of ultimate significance. As I do so, I encounter the sacred realm which is the transition point between endings and new beginnings. It is as if my words are pulling me into new realms of existence. I am writing myself out of the deep hole I once found myself in. This is the spiritual power of transformative writing. I found light by peering into the darkness. As a survivor of a suicide attempt, I feel responsible to share my story asa lived experience. I write to offer a singular perspective on what it feels like to be suicidal, attempt suicide, survive, and be radically transformed by the experience. While I am hardly the first person to attempt suicide, I have felt theuniquenessof my story. I am one of the few writers on suicide who has been a seasoned therapist, teacher, author, and patient. I write to comprehend the paradoxical richness of my story, the wisdom it has bequeathed to me, and the insights I might share with others. I write to describe my inner experience; what I feel now, what I felt then, and their interconnection. In my writing, I seek transformation and transcendence, a sense of insight and awareness about what is of ultimate significance. One of the striking things about writing is how it has changed me as a person. Who I was is not who I am now, but I could not be who I am without writing about what I've been going through. Nine years ago, I was suffering from the ancient sin ofacediawhich the thirteenth century philosopher, St. Thomas Aquinas defined as a \"loss of energy to begin new things.\" I felt like I was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders. In the depths of despair, I lacked perspective, unable to see the sacredness of life itself. To move forward, I had to face my suicide attempt for what it was. At the time, I didn't recognize my survival as the opportunity it was. It felt inauspicious, unlikely to ever be seen as a blessing. But as Ileaned intothe pain, I came to appreciate being a member of what Albert Schweitzer called the \"brotherhood of those who bear the mark of pain.\" The more I befriended my pain, the less it burdened me. My painlessenswhen I am less afraid of it. The more Iacceptit, the less it overwhelms me. It has been my responsibility to play an active role in finding meaning to my suffering; to learn and grow from the experience. This viewpoint has allowed me to grow into the person I am becoming. I am grateful that God graced me with the wisdom and courage to persevere. From Holocaust survivor, Elie Wiesel, I learned \"to begin something new is a wonderous thing. But to lose everything and be able to begin over again is nothing less than a miracle.\" For the first time in my life, I now fully appreciate the blessing of being alive. It is only in hindsight, that I can see how transformational these losses have been. I've looked to the spiritual traditions, not just social psychology, to guide me on my journey. If I was to thrive and not merely survive, I had to walk down what Native Americans call theRed Road, a metaphoric symbol of healing and transformation. It took many months for me to see my losses as harbingers of new beginnings. Converting memories of loss to memories of meaning has been my ongoing existential task. While I'm a fairly stationary person, I've traveled many miles in my imagination. My healing imagination resists the idea that I should not feel the pain of the past. From the beginning, others wanted me to \"be over\" the pain without understanding that grieving is an ongoing and life-affirming process. Grief is not a pathological process to be cured. My quest has been to experience grief, not classify it. In the process, I have a profound sense of gratitude for my continued life. I don't need to bring the nebulous concept of \"closure\" to my old life to feel fully alive today. Imposing a semblance of meaning to what had once been so traumatizing, allows me to feel better, think more clearly, and function with more confidence. Reducing the chatter in my brain has allowed me to be more discerning. I have created a calming distance between my thoughts now, and what happened then. Being mindful in the present does not mean I'm not affected by the past. I still have anxiety but I no longer have the agitation that once overwhelmed me. I no longer fear dying alone and unloved, because I am no longer alone and unloved. Of this, I am sure. If it was up to me, I would plead for eternal life in this world. I don't want to die but when I do, I want my life to bewell-lived.I need to feel that my life has mattered, that in my small way, I have contributed something of value to the human experience. I want my writing to be an important part of my spiritual legacy. Much of the value of writing about trauma is in how words are received. I have found power, a sense of personal efficacy when my words influence and inspire others. The most common response to my writing has been, \"Wow Michael, this is going to help a lot of people when it is published.\" Writing has helped me understand my experience by using transformative language that helps reshape my sense of self and relationships with others. As I pass through the seasons of my life, I appreciate the wisdom of singer Joni Mitchell who wrote, \"Something's lost, but something's gained, in living every day.\" It's been said that you cannot have a testimony without a test. I had to go through a cleansing fire to rise from the ashes. For the first time in my life, I am truly happy to be alive. Living a life of meaning has been the guiding light that illuminates my path forward, allowing me to see beyond myself. My highest aspiration is when I die, my friends and loved one's will say a hearty and eternal \"Amen.\" Read part two:On Living with Parkinson's Disease Michael Robin is a clinical social worker with more than forty years of experience.",

    "data": "Today I attended the funeral of my friend and neighbor of 35 years, Ms. Enid. No one knew her exact age except for her best friend Ruby, another neighbor here at the Roycroft, our six-storey art deco apartment building that we all lived in. Enid was distinguished and healthy, but dementia grabbed her sensibilities in her last year. Because she was single and had no family, she was sent to a nursing home far away from the Roycroft and her friends, a good forty-minutes drive on the highway. Her death has had a huge impact on me. I miss her tremendously, of course, and her passing has made me reflect upon my own situation. You see, I'm single too. Even though I have my will in place and am relatively healthy (despite the Canadian health system), financially stable, and of sound mind and soul, I'm not sure that my end-of-life wishes will be carried out. Who will be my advocate? I've selected two executors, but in reality, in the absence of caring family or friends, I worry that no one monitors the executor. What happens if there's no one left alive to watch over you and your belongings? Can the executor do anything he/she pleases with their client's estate, body, burial, and belongings? It seems the courts only step in if someone blows the whistle. Enid's funeral service seemed designed more to please the needs of her estate lawyer than to please her. When I asked him where Enid wanted to be buried, he admitted that he had never asked her. Her ashes were to be shipped two hours away to a cemetery where he believed her parents are buried. I asked him if Enid wanted to be buried with her parents. He said he hadn't asked her. How could that happen, I thought? Interestingly, Enid did have the wherewithal to state that her obituary NOT print her age. Good for you, Enid. Age should be irrelevant, and besides, it's no one's business. These days when we hear a person's age, assumptions form. An older person is rarely thought of as being or having ever been vital, skilled or talented, and yet, many were and are. While other cultures honor and respect their elderly population, North America seems to dismiss the thought that a senior can be captivating, attractive and interesting. Adding insult to injury, seniors are often referred to as 'cute'. A puppy is cute. A baby is cute (sometimes). Unfortunately, after a certain age, people become a member of the invisible race. (I should keep that in mind the next time I want to steal something.) Enid's memorial service was different than those I've been to, particularly because she had no living relatives, no one to eulogize her life from personal experience, and no one to shed tears the way primary mourners do. I cried plenty when I received the news of her death, but somehow that's not the same thing. Or is it? Enid's friends didn't want to speak at her service, so I was asked to say something. I spoke about being Enid's neighbor for over three decades and what she meant to me. I spoke about the night we spent together one New Year's Eve, sharing stories while she polished her late mother's silverware, an annual ritual. I spoke about the answer she gave me when asked how she maintained such a close friendship with Ruby for over 60 years. \"Two things, Marla...boundaries and privacy.\" And I spoke about the best advice she ever gave me: \"Take a walk every day, and have a goal for your destination. It could be to buy an apple, or the newspaper. Most importantly Marla, get out and move.\" As I looked out into the faces of Enid's few mourners--just eleven neighbors from The Roycroft, her cleaning lady, and our superintendent--I thought about the sense of community we had created, complete with love, hate, and disparity. When Enid's memorial concluded and we crowded around her boxed ashes, and fragile-framed portrait, her lawyer asked a painful question: \"Does anyone want Enid's photographs?\" Enid's photographs were respectfully scattered about the memorial room as if it was a staged set. We didn't know who the people in the photos were or their importance to Enid. But there they sat, and what to do with them now was our dilemma. These photos may have been of her parents, or treasured aunts and cousins. We shall never know, now. What we did know was that no one wanted them, not even Ruby (who is also single with no family and 95 years young). Perhaps for Ruby it is just too painful a reminder of what she will miss. I wonder how long she will last without Enid, her best friend, to walk with and talk with and share meals with, especially on Christmas Eve and New Year's Day. An 8x10\" portrait of a younger Enid now sits in our lobby, with a battery-operated votive candle beside it. Soon it will be removed, tossed into the trash and driven to the city dump where it too, will become ashes. Questions swirl around in my mind. Is this how the single population in our society end up? Our once cherished photographs recording our life, loves and lineage all to be tossed into the garbage? What becomes of their worth, their knowledge, and their very existence? Deep in my heart, I know that my photos, articles, and recordings of my careers will also end up in the city dump along with the other single people's tangible memories. They are nobody's keepsakes but mine. For now, I'm going to dust off my framed articles of me as standup comic, inspirational speaker, and jazz singer, as well as my photo collection of family members and dogs. I'll try not to think about what will become of them when I am gone. A common epitaph is: \"You Will Live in Our Hearts Forever.\" Another popular one is \"Gone, but not forgotten.\" I'm starting a new one: \"Ashes to Ash, Tossed in the Trash.\" I've learned a lot from Enid's death. We must all legally prepare for our inevitable passing, and get our specific needs, desires and end-of-life arrangements down on paper, while we are mentally able to do so. And we should have someone outside of the executor's circle making sure our wishes are respected. Some find it morbid to discuss such matters. The truth is, it's imperative. I'm feeling a bit low today and I know what Enid would tell me. She'd say \"Marla, go for a walk. Pick a goal for your destination. Buy an apple, a newspaper, it really doesn't matter what. Just get moving. It will make you feel better.\" I think she's right. Marla Lukofskyis an Inspirational Speaker, Comedian, Singer, Cancer Survivor and Writer.

    "data": "At 44, Karin had a successful career and three nearly-grown children. Then, in 2004, she began a relationship that at first felt dreamy but slowly deteriorated. Eventually, Karin found herself in a position she never imagined: as the victim of domestic violence. Initially, her partner seemed lovely. He was a respected member of her community, well known for his dedication to volunteer work and he was amazingly attentive and romantic. Over time, though, the relationship changed. It was a gradual progression spanning four years, starting with emotional and psychological abuse, and eventually escalating to physical abuse. Here, Karin bravely shares her story of surviving domestic violence. It's a narrative that illustrates how insidious this process can be, and how difficult it is to get out of such relationships. As a survivor, Karin has struggled with her own shame and the guilt she feels for exposing her children to this situation. Today, after a lot of hard work and self-reflection, Karin feels stronger than ever. \"I was determined to come out of this kicking,\" she said. \"And I have.\" She has a great job and volunteers for a domestic violence prevention organization; her grown children are doing well and she is newly married. Karin's story is a reminder that this could happen to any of us, and underscores the importance of trusting your own instinct about what feels right and what feels wrong in a relationship. Domestic violence, defined by the United States Department of Justice \"as a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate partner\" permeates our culture. It is estimated that at least 1 in 4 women in the United states will experience domestic violence in their lifetime, and while both men and women can be targeted, the victim is female 85-95% of the time. Domestic violence occurs across all races, ethnicities, socio-economic backgrounds, sexual orientations and religions. Abuse, based on fear and intimidation, can be physical, emotional, psychological, economic, and/or sexual. On a societal level, the costs of domestic violence are tremendous. Health related costs alone are estimated to exceed $5.8 billion annually. As in Karin's case, domestic violence typically escalates over time. Homicide is often the end result. It is believed that 33% of all female murder victims are killed by in intimate partner. For the most part, these homicides are predictable and preventable. By educating ourselves about the issue, we can all become a part of the solution. Most importantly, Karin wants everyone to know that resources are available. If you have any concerns, seek help.

    "data": "Want a glimpse of what opioid addiction really looks like? Meet Vinnie: a self-described \"regular\" guy from Revere, Mass., and a recovering drug addict. Toothless, and 60, Vinnie was prescribed opioids -- Oxycodone, Oxycontin, Dilaudid, among others -- for a chronic pain condition. Though he says he never intended to abuse these medications, Vinnie became an addict, taking painkillers for 28 years as his doctors kept prescribing higher and higher doses to manage his pain. Listen to his story here: Vinnie stopped caring about anything except opioids, and finding his next dose of medication. His marriage fell apart. He missed opportunities to spend time with his only daughter as she grew up. He became estranged from friends. He stopped taking care of his body and lost his teeth, gained 100 pounds, and developed diabetes, heart disease and arthritis. He fundamentally lost his will to live and contemplated suicide. Ultimately, it was a pharmacist who put a stop to Vinnie's opioid use by refusing to fill his prescription. After his initial panic, this abrupt end to the drugs led Vinnie to connect to a new doctor, an addiction specialist. His new regimen included a slow tapering of the narcotics and the initiation of Suboxone therapy. The state and nation are in the midst of an escalating opioid crisis -- it's estimated that 67 Americans died each day from opioid overdoses in 2013, and the number of deaths from drug overdoses was three times that of the combined deaths from car accidents and homicides in that same year. Just this week Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Bakerenlisted medical schoolsto provide more addiction-related training to medical students. Against this backdrop, Vinnie's story shows the harsh reality of addiction as well as a path to recovery. How to fix it? It's clear that a multifaceted approach is needed, as outlined in an extensivereportput out by Gov. Baker's Opioid Working Group in June. One element, relevant to Vinnie, is consideration of one of several medications available to treat opioid addiction, including methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone. Currently, these medications are underused, partly because they are controversial. Access can be tough, as the majority of treatment centers don't provide such medications, and many insurers don't cover them or have strict rules on how and for how long they can be prescribed. Suboxone, the drug Vinnie takes, is a combination of buprenorphine and naltrexone, a partial opioid agonist to reduce drug cravings and an opioid antagonist added in small amounts in an effort to prevent abuse. This medicine is much easier to get than methadone (patients can take it home instead of having to go to a clinic every day), and it can be used both for medically supervised opioid withdrawal and for long-term maintenance therapy. So, what's the controversy? Some argue that use of Suboxone (and methadone) is just replacing one addiction for another. It is still an opiate-like compound, and one that is habit-forming. In addition, Suboxone has street value. It has become increasingly popular among addicts as a means of curbing opiate withdrawal symptoms, bridging the gap until opioids can be obtained, and perhaps, because there is a market for it, providing an income source to allow for the purchase of more illicit drugs. Does this mean we shouldn't use the medication?Dataclearly show that medications like Suboxone and methadone are saving lives, decreasing the spread of infectious diseases, decreasing criminal behavior and improving social functioning among addicts. And Vinnie's story certainly argues in favor of Suboxone. As he says: It gave him back his life.

    "data": "I consider it my purpose in life to make a difference and fight for every second of feeling well. I will promote awareness and try to help others get to a decent place in their lives until I can't do it anymore. Hi, my name is Laura and I have gastroparesis. I have had type 1 diabetes for 36 years. My gastroparesis was caused from my diabetes. Like most folks with gastroparesis, I did not recognize the early symptoms for years. In April of 2001, I was taken to the hospital with fears of a heart attack due to the incredible pain coming from my chest. They found nothing and it seemed to go away on its own. About a week later, I started having nausea and vomiting 24/7. One doctor did an endoscopy and had to literally scoop the food out of my stomach for an hour and ended up cauterizing 20 small stomach ulcers. The next two years were nothing short of hell. My doctors had no idea what was going on. I had hospitalization after hospitalization, test after test after test. I also had my gallbladder out. During this time, I lost 60 percent of my body weight and was not doing well at all. Luckily for me, my PCP went looking through medical websites for doctors to see if he could find out anything for me. To my absolutely miraculous luck, he found a doctor in Kansas City, Kansas, who was doing an FDA study on the Entera Neurostimulator for gastroparesis. His article, written about diabetic people with gastroparesis, could have been written about me. My doctor printed it out for me, and we talked about it. He spoke to my local gastroenterologist and a week later I was off to Kansas to be part of an FDA study for the stimulator. I had the implant done, all the testing, and six monthly visits from Massachusetts to Kansas. Although it helped with the incredibly strong nausea, it only did a so-so job overall. I was also given a J tube, which actually saved my life. I was now able to get medication into my system, bypassing my stomach, so that it would actually help me. I spent the next 7-8 years with both good and bad days, and at least 10 to 15 hospitalizations every year. In 2012, I went to a local doctor who monitored my stimulator, as the batteries were getting ready to die. Unfortunately, it's not as simple as changing a battery; you have to have an entirely new device implanted. I had the surgery in December of 2012 and did not get sick again until Thanksgiving of the same year. I've had my stimulator turned up in intensity in hopes of keeping the nausea at bay. It has done a very good job, all things considered, and I can proudly say that I have not been hospitalized since the new one was implanted in 2012. I still experience frequent pain and bloating, but I can cope with these symptoms. The 24/7 nausea and vomiting was what was killing me. When I was out in Kansas, one of my doctors gave me a number for a nonprofit gastric motility organization. It turns out it was right here in my home state of Massachusetts. I joined, but nothing really happened for a few years. Then, one day, I accidentally got someone else's newsletter from them and called to let them know they had the address wrong. A conversation began. I had been struggling since my diagnosis with the fact that I previously had a very good career and a wonderful husband, and now here I was a sick person, with what seemed to be no purpose in life. The motility organization helped me to have a purpose in my life by helping others cope with this disease. I began reading and hearing about other patients who were coming down with gastroparesis, and their stories were just like mine - doctors looked at them like they were crazy because these doctors had never heard of a paralyzed stomach disorder. I am fully disabled, unable to work, and I'm not well most of the time, but I do not let that stop me. I pushed and pushed as a volunteer, and I am currently a mentor who calls other people with this disease who are looking for a friend, someone to relate to. Now, after some years of working with the motility organization, I have had a chance to actually see the difference that I have made in some people's lives. This gives me a reason to get up every day and the pleasure of knowing that I have made a difference by putting a smile on someone's face, or relieving someone's stress when they didn't think that was possible. I now spend all of my good times volunteering and just talking to others with this disease to let them know that they are not alone, and that it is not in their head. This is a horrible disease that currently has limited medication or therapies to help. There are over 5 million people with gastroparesis in the US, and it is hard to find two people who have gone through the same exact experience. What helps one person doesn't necessarily help another, and a medication that helps today might not work tomorrow. Likewise, a food you can eat today might make you vomit and feel bloated tomorrow. It is a constant trial. This disease has to be one of the hardest to deal with in terms of quality of life. Your whole world needs to change to a \"new normal\" with new dreams and wants. Between the disease and all the medications, it is hard for me to get up and get going every day. It would be so much easier to curl up under my covers and stay in bed constantly. That's how we all feel. In addition, I have found that almost everyone I have spoken to with any gastric disorder like this has felt abandoned by family and friends. In some cases, lack of understanding causes people to stay away. Now, when I am asked if I will attend activities or functions, my answer is, \"Yes, I will be there if the disease lets me.\" Gastroparesis can flare up at any moment. I can be completely fine, feeling wonderful, and in less than 60 seconds, I am trying to find somewhere I can throw up. I have been very lucky to have a husband who really meant \"in sickness and in health,\" as this hit me 5 days prior to our one-year anniversary. Many husbands would have left by now, because they can't understand this disease or just can't handle it My diagnosis was a huge surprise to me. Even being a diabetic, I had never heard of gastroparesis. It is an overwhelmingly hard and complicated disorder that needs more awareness. Gastric motility disorders need to be brought to the forefront of research. I do as much volunteering and helping as I can, but I am only one. I consider it my purpose in life to make a difference and fight for every second of feeling well. I will promote awareness and try to help others get to a decent place in their lives until I can't do it anymore.",

    "data": "An Interview with Marisa Renee Lee By Val Walker No matter how difficult her day might have been, Marisa's best bet for beating the blues is to read stories of people helping others. She loves to learn how people turned empathy into action with kindness, thoughtfulness and resourcefulness. Following her passion, Marisa and her friend, Jackie Scharnick, launched a website in 2018 called Supportal which is dedicated to publishing first-hand accounts of friends helping friends who are experiencing life-changing challenges. Supportal is devoted to celebrating the infinitely possible ways that empathy calls us into action--as caregivers, as comforters and as wonderful friends. In short, as Supportal's tagline says, \"Being there starts here.\" About Marisa Marisa Renee Lee is a graduate of Harvard College and an avid Green Bay Packers fan. She resides in Falls Church, Virginia with her husband Matt and their dog Sadie. In 2007, Marisa founded The Pink Agenda, a breast cancer non-profit, in honor of her mother Lisa. Almost a decade later, The Pink Agenda is now a national organization of young professionals committed to raising money for breast cancer research and direct care service programs in partnership with The Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Today Marisa is a cross-sector leader dedicated to engaging the private sector to help solve public problems. In addition to her work on Supportal, Marisa runs a social impact firm that allows her to support a variety of institutions on organizational design and development, public-private partnership strategies, change management, and stakeholder engagement. Until 2017 Marisa served as the Managing Director of the My Brother's Keeper Alliance (MBK Alliance), a nonprofit born out of President Obama's call to action to address the barriers to success that boys and young men of color (BYMOC) disproportionately face along the life path. Through her work with MBK Alliance, Marisa leads a collaborative, cross-sectoral movement that unites business, philanthropy, nonprofit, and community leaders, to increase pathways of opportunity for BYMOC. Photo: Marisa with her mother About Supportal Supportal's mission is to show people how to turn empathy into action. Marisa learned much about the wisdom of empathy at a young age as her mother's primary caregiver as she struggled with multiple sclerosis and eventually succumbed to breast cancer. She and her friend, Jackie Scharmick, a survivor of leukemia, founded Supportal to help others cope with demanding ordeals where we find ourselves strapped, isolated and overwhelmed. Marisa and Jackie are committed to ensuring that \"no one will have to go it alone. A Conversation with Marisa Val: What brings you joy in your work with Supportal? Marisa: Supportal's mission gives me joy: Helping people help others. I love reading people's stories of kindness, thoughtfulness, and comfort. Supportal gathers stories of people helping others who are going through hard times. It brings me joy to know that good things are happening out there, and that people are really showing up, not just making vague promises. People need encouragement, but they also need to celebrate the action that has been taken--the difference it has made in their lives. We need to celebrate empathy in action. Val: How do you see the internet and social media helping to bring people together around difficult issues such as illness, grief, loneliness, or other losses? Marisa: One simple example: My friend from years ago shared his story on Facebook Messenger about losing his father. I hadn't heard from him for so very long, and I didn't know he'd lost his father, the only living parent he had in his life. It was great to hear from him that all of my sharing about grief and loss made him feel less alone in his own grief. It reminded me that the online spaces--Supportal, social media, etc., can be a great way for people to find connection with others going through similar experiences. No one needs to be alone. Val: Do you think the internet and social media can cause social isolation? Marisa: If young people, especially children and teens, are onscreen too much of the time, I think it can be damaging for their social development and limits their social skills--just being able to have conversations. Also, social media can set us up to believe in unrealistic expectations--standards that we can never live up to. It's isolating to feel that we aren't living the way we think we are \"supposed\" to be living. That's why I think it's important for us to share real stories online like the ones found on Supportal. So, yes, there can be a downside to social media, but at the same time it can play an important role in bringing people together. It really is all a balancing act. Val: What is in store for Supportal? Marisa: I'm developing Supportal to be a one-stop-shop for what to do when something bad happens to someone you care about. If someone we love suffers from a divorce, a miscarriage, a job loss, or a death, what can we say and do? How can we help? Supportal provides readers with first-hand accounts of people who have been through a life-changing challenge and share what helped them most. We provide ideas for gifts, goods, services, and practical tips for how to show up for those in need. Val: It's heartening that Supportal teaches us through stories that show us how to support people in distress. There's nothing like real-life experience for how to comfort others! Marisa: Right. Stories are wonderful for giving examples of empathy in action, how to respond to our friends and loved ones who are in difficult circumstances. Stories have a way of showing us what to do. Stories are about challenges and how we face them--but we don't have to be alone facing those challenges-- let's celebrate the ways we are supported by others! That's why I co-created Supportal. We don't have to do it all alone. Val: Thanks for sharing your time with us! Marisa: Thank you--this was fun! More about Marisa Marisa's background is remarkably extensive, and I would like to share more here In 2010, Marisa joined the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) as an appointee in the Obama Administration. During that time, she was able to begin to combine her passion for service with her finance and small business background.

Marisa supported the Agency's program offices on outreach, restructuring and creating new lending programs, and the formulation and implementation of policies to promote entrepreneurship. Marisa also coordinated minority business engagement activities across the Obama Administration. Additionally, Marisa spearheaded a series of Urban Economic Forums co-hosted by the White House and the SBA. These forums connected thousands of urban entrepreneurs to public, non-profit, and private sector business development resources. In 2013, Marisa accepted a position with the White House Domestic Policy Council as a Senior Policy Advisor for Urban Affairs and Economic Mobility. Marisa directed all engagement efforts for the President's Ladders of Opportunity and Promise Zones initiatives.

    "data": "I sit down in the chair opposite yours. It's a lovely day outside: Spring peeks her head out along the esplanade, the sun warms our space beside your bed. You don't know me. I am a stranger to you, but you let me stay anyway. Our conversation starts slowly: small talk about the weather, hospital food. Then we shift; the gradual dance of vulnerability between strangers begins. You take a breath, and begin letting me into your life. I listen and learn. About your frustrations. About how long you have been here, in this hospital, beneath the fluorescent lights. About the lack of answers, the constant struggle for control. I nod and murmur. Now you talk about your family. About feeling like a burden to them, being here, sick, dying. Now you talk about depression, the loneliness of death, how narrow the tunnel becomes when you're heading towards its end. You talk now as a human being struggling to hold onto your humanity. Gingerly, I reach across the sun-lit space. I hold your hand, but I say nothing. What is there to say in the face of human suffering? Where words fail, touch and silence speak. -------- For the past two years I have been blessed to work as a palliative care volunteer in a hospital. My job is simple: to provide company to patients who are chronically ill or dying. Really, I just serve as a companion - to sit with, to talk to, to watch TV beside, to listen to music with. In this role, doing these simple things, I have received one of the greatest gifts of my life: through others' stories of suffering and joy, I know the beauty of a shared humanity. If healthcare is defined as curing or fixing, then I am essentially helpless as a volunteer - I have no skills, knowledge, or experience that can cure or fix these people. However, I have come to learn through time spent with my patients that sometimes it is not knowledge, tools, or skills that are required for healing. Rather, healing can be wrought by each of us simply as we are, as people. Sometimes all we need to provide a moment of healing for one another lies in the ways in which we are able to hold, sit, and simply be in each other's company. From my patients, I've learned something both humbling and empowering: in a world where we are constantly trying to fix, sometimes it's okay to just sit together and be broken in our own separate ways. It is through the cracks within us that the healing enters. Claire Stauffer is a recent graduate of Boston College, where she majored in Biology and English. She serves as an EMT-B and palliative care volunteer in the Boston area. Her first narrative piece \"Weight\" was featured in the Boston College Medical Humanities Journal and on the HSC College Voices blog.",

    "data": "Picture this scene: It was winter in 2011. I was 35 years old. I had two little kids, a girl and a boy. Clare was 4 and Hayes was 1. My husband Sam was totally engaged in family life, a great husband. My book publishing job was full time and included frequent travel. I was trying to take care of the kids, to be a good wife and good friend, to exercise, to eat well, to cook, to read, to stay up to date on current events, to relax, to meditate, to travel, to volunteer at our preschool. I knew that I could do all I wanted to do and I was happy a lot of the time. But as much as I was happy, I was exhausted and cranky. I remember saying to Sam that I couldn't maintain the level of intensity, that my body was breaking. I was worn out. On the last Sunday in February, I felt a lump in my right breast. Since Hayes was still nursing, there were lumps and bumps, but this felt different. More solid. I went to my midwife's office on Monday morning, and the nurse agreed that the lump felt unusual. In fact, the cheerful banter about the kids immediately stopped when she felt the lump. Her face was instantly serious, drained of color. She recommended that I have a biopsy and she scheduled it for Thursday of that week. That was my first mammogram and my last. The experience of the mammogram and biopsy was fine. I was a little scared, a little shaken, a little teary but at that point there was a 50% chance that the lump would be nothing to worry about. Life would go on as usual. But that of course is not what happened. The results of the biopsy came back on Monday morning. The same nurse who helped during both of my pregnancies and who sent me to the hospital for the test called me that morning. She said that all of the details of the biopsy were not back. The preliminary news: You have breast cancer. It is invasive duct cancer. We can't tell you more at this point. You have a meeting with a great team of doctors at Mass General next week.What?? On the one hand, this was shocking news. I have breast cancer? I am 35 years old. I have two babies. I have a full time job. I have plans. How is this happening? On the other hand, cancer had always been looming on the edges. My mom died of pancreatic cancer when I was 2, my brother was almost 6, and she was 33. There was a haunting feeling that we were reliving history. The ages were too close, the story too close. I knew what Sam and my kids could lose. The pain is real and forever. [I want to pause here for a second. I have a hard time untangling my cancer story from my life story. My mom's death is certainly part of my cancer story, but it is important to note that it is really the central theme of my life story. Her death changed everything--from where I grew up to how I grew up to the person I married and to how I mother. My cancer story exists within her cancer story.]. In the days after the diagnosis, I was in organizational mode. I spent a lot of time organizing my office, calling family and friends, grasping for control. At our first medical appointment, we talked about my cancer--about the stage, the grade, and the plan. Sam and I left with a clear idea of how MGH would treat my cancer. I would have a lumpectomy, followed by chemo, and maybe by radiation. We had a team in place. We felt in good hands. At the recommendation of the doctors, I decided on genetic testing for a breast cancer gene mutation. It was notable that my mom had cancer in her early 30s as well, even though it was a different cancer, one that I always thought was not inherited. What I didn't know before my diagnosis is that pancreatic cancer has a dotted line to the BRCA mutations. A few weeks later, on a really crisp and bright morning, our little house was buzzing. I was getting ready for work, the nanny had just arrived, my husband was using the vacuum in the kitchen, Hayes was crying, Clare was saying \"Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom.\" The phone rang. It was my surgeon. The rest of the world fell back, sound faded, as I heard her words: You're BRCA1 positive. This changes the course of treatment. We recommend a double mastectomy, followed by chemo and radiation. For whatever reason, I immediately agreed to this path. I was not reluctant to have the surgery, even though I nursed my babies for a long time and was still nursing Hayes. I was attached to my breasts, but I knew they had to go. I wanted every single breast cell to be history. The mastectomy would be followed by breast reconstruction and an oophorectomy because of an increased risk of ovarian cancer. At that point, I didn't understand the long-term consequences of taking out my ovaries, removing my breasts, but even if I had, I would have moved forward with this plan. I wanted to do everything possible. Waiting for the surgery was hard. The mind plays tricks: I knew that I could feel the tumor growing. I could feel it move to my lymph nodes. The surgery was on March 31. I don't remember arriving at the hospital, meeting with the doctors, going under--really any of it. I do remember my parents at the hospital. I remember being incredibly out of it. I remember a friend visiting, though only vaguely. Day by day, I felt better. At the end of April, I was accepted into a clinical trial which required a full body scan in preparation. Though my oncologist was confident that the cancer had not spread, I was happy to have the scan for peace of mind. A baseline. I went to MGH West for the day with my oldest and best friend Rosie. I drank the awful drink, we laughed, goofed around, and headed home. I was not nervous at all. We had been home for about an hour when the phone rang. It was my doctor. Something in the liver looked suspicious and a biopsy was scheduled for the next morning. The biopsy was the worst experience of my life. The giddiness of the day before was gone. I was terrified. My husband took me to the appointment in the bowels of MGH-no windows, no private room. Curtains only. The anesthesia did not totally knock me out because the doctors needed me to respond to cues. The suspicious spot was behind my ribs so the needle went between two ribs. The medicine made me sick. I vomited so much that blood vessels were popped on my face. I couldn't speak. Finally, around 8:00 my husband wheeled me out and we were home soon after. My daughter ran up to me--I remember in pink tulle--but I couldn't speak and I was too weak to even hug her. I slowly carried myself upstairs and into bed. This was a very physical experience. I felt so annihilated by the experience that I didn't have the energy to worry about the biopsy results. The results were fine. The cancer hadn't moved. The suspicious spot was a lesion that has now been monitored for five years and hasn't changed. We stayed on course. Chemo started in early May. I got through chemo. I very rarely felt nauseated like I thought I would. What I did feel was totally crazy. I was wired and not thinking straight. I was wide awake but totally out of it. I felt out of my mind. Surprisingly, over time, I began to feel healthy and confident with my cancer look. I loved the shape of my bald head and the colorful scarves. I felt beautiful, but not always. During a visit by my incredible sister-in-law Mary Lou, I happened to catch a glimpse of my naked body in a mirror. I was thin. I was bald. My breasts were gone, with only the shape of my expanders and stiches where my nipples used to be. My chest had been dug out up to my collar bones, so the upper chest was concave. The scar from Hayes' delivery a year earlier was still red. It was shocking. The hug that she gave me in that moment literally held me up. Without her I would have collapsed in despair. She supported me and the moment passed. Our family was in survival mode. During the treatment, my dad assured me that my story would be different than my mom's story, that the times had changed, that my cancer was not her cancer, and that my ending would be a happy one. But the chance that I would leave these kids was too real. The kids were little so cancer was not tangible to them in the way it would be to older kids, but it was hard on them. Our routine was destroyed. Clare turned 5 that May. Clare is amazing, full of life and vigor. She fights for what she wants--and at age 5, she wanted attention, sweets, and TV. People were coming and going. Everyone had different tactics for disciplining her. And different tactics for spoiling her. Presents, ice cream, pedicures. It was so confusing for her. Hayes was a baby. After the surgery, I couldn't lift him out of his crib. I couldn't hold him. I stopped nursing him. I felt as if I was abandoning him. In August, after my chemo had ended and I was feeling better, I was on a walk with Hayes and Sam. Hayes wouldn't come to me, and Sam said, accurately, \"He doesn't trust you anymore.\" My heart was broken. But then, moment by moment and day by day, we rebuilt our bonds. During my cancer treatment, many people suggested that I go back to work for at least a year and a half, to find normalcy again. This was great advice, helping me to put other things besides cancer on center stage. But in June 2015, about four years after the diagnosis, I packed up my desk and headed home. I really wanted to be with my kids, to raise them, to mother. I felt that I was missing too much. We've spent the last year living normal lives--doing homework and extracurriculars, lounging, traveling, bickering, cooking, exercising. It has been a great year, filled with bumpy life. My health has been good, and my trips to the cancer center have slowed down. Cancer still has my attention (when I had a stomach bug recently I asked my husband if he thought it could be metastasized cancer--he didn't), but it is not the focal point. It is part of my story, not my entire story. It is my story, not my mom's story. And I am thankful for this.",

    "data": "A tumor. The first time I noticed \"It,\" I was looking at my reflection in a dingy bathroom. \"Hello,\" It introduced itself, \"I'm new, but I'll be here awhile.\" It was a lump on my neck, found only because it cast a shadow. \"Do you have a name?\" I asked, hoping in vain that this time It would answer. Silence, as always, would follow. Just the steadiness of my heartbeat, pulsing blood through my veins--through It, feeding It, helping It grow. Out of my control, yet within me. I bargained with that silence as if it would have made a difference. \"If you go away, I'll go to the gym more. I'll eat fewer desserts.\" Still silence. \"I'll work harder in school. Go to the gym EVERY day. Eat no dessert.\" Still silence. But the bargain felt complete, and the silence less threatening, and Its presence retreated back into the corners of my brain. I carried on, hating the body that put me in this position. Feeling helpless to do anything, yet determined to do something--if I couldn't control It, I'd control everything else. This cycle repeated for months. Until the first time It broke the silence. \"My name is Danger,\" It said, \"and you should fear me.\" \"What kind of Danger?\" I asked. But my translator, the doctor, didn't know. It wasn't speaking clearly yet. The doctor needed to make a personal visit. Needed to cut It open and confront It. Surgery. So It had a name. A vague name: Danger. But I was no closer to knowing what kind of Danger. An urgent one? A false one? \"It's most likely nothing,\" the doctor said. The visit would be a formality, just to confirm this. The Danger's silence was deafening. I went back to bargaining, desperate for more control; more information. My bargaining had me eating too little, working too hard, and stressed out about how to act 'normal.' I looked like I had it all together, people later told me. Wrong: I was a sad and anxious human. In the midst of these bargains, I learned about cultivating a gratitude practice while scouring health blogs for diet tips. Be grateful, and happiness will follow, the experts said. I wanted to be happy. So I would wake up 5 minutes earlier and list what I was grateful for. My family, my friends...the usual. Then 5 minutes became 10, and I listed more things: the opportunities to attend college, and to live near the best hospitals in the world. One morning, there was something new on the list. I hadn't planned it. It just slipped out unexpectedly: \"I'm grateful for my body.\" What?! My body, inhabited by Danger, my elusive enemy? My body, the home of that tumor? No, that can't be right, I told myself. But then I thought about it. My body lets me run and jump and sing and laugh and love. My body was fighting back against Danger and all his pervasive silence. Okay...maybe I could be grateful for my body. It became my mantra. Even on days when I didn't believe it, I expressed gratitude for my body. In the beginning, that was most days. But I had believed once, so I knew I could believe again. The next time Danger broke his silence, it wasn't good news. The visit that my doctor paid didn't confirm It was \"nothing.\" \"I'm sorry, but it was cancerous.\" So that's your real name. Not \"It.\" Not \"Danger.\" Cancer. But the name, Cancer, was liberating. While fog had once obscured the path to health, now I had a flashlight, and a map. Now I knew my enemy. How to fight him. How to beat him. I think that I'd known all along that It was really Cancer. It hadn't felt like a friendly tumor when I first found it. It felt wrong, full of dark energy. Panic and anxiety greeted me whenever I examined It in the mirror. But now that it's all over, pride greets me when I look in the mirror. My scar is a daily reminder that two surgeries and radiation sent Cancer packing. My body fought back. She wouldn't let the worst happen because she was strong and full of love. Now, when I run or jump or sing or laugh or love, it's a victory lap. Cancer wanted to rob me of fully embracing life, but I didn't let it. There wasn't one specific moment when I realized that I had really started living; there were lots of small moments that added up: Like on the day I was three months clean, and my friends surprised me with an enormous card telling me how proud they were and how much they loved me. That was the day I realized that I didn't fight cancer alone for a single moment. Or when I was eight months clean, when I walked out of class at the Sorbonne and realized I was living out a childhood dream, to study in Paris. That was the day I realized that I should continue to dream, because those dreams could come true. Or when I was sixteen months clean, and the leader for a retreat I had agreed to help with kept poking just a little bit more than anyone else had at my feelings about cancer, and I admitted out loud for the first time that I had been scared. That I had pretended I wasn't so no one would worry about me. That was the day I realized the importance of being truly vulnerable and honest with myself about my feelings. Really living means being aggressively friendly to friends new and old. It means saying yes to pizza AND fries, because life is too short to choose. It means running faster, jumping higher, singing louder, laughing longer, and loving deeper. Really living means I don't bargain with the silence. I fill it with life.

    "data": "By Laura Stepnicka Invisible illnesses are all I know and have reshaped every fiber of my being. Many develop mental anguishafteryears of managing crippling chronic pain - but I went reverse course. In 2016, I was in a battle for my life. That battle was my own internal battle. I nearly did not survive. My mind was being ravaged by what would soon be diagnosed Major Depressive Disorder. The subtle signs had been running under the current for some time, but once depression truly took root, it would not relent. Depression ravaged my mind and distorted every single shred of reality. Of perception. Of clarity. During the darkest depths of my battle with mental illness, the disease stole my strength, clarity, cognitive functioning, and ability to make even the simplest of decisions. I became a shell of a human. The previously super social creature I was became a mute. I withdrew from people I loved. I stopped being able to do my job. I stopped knowing how to live. The mind is so powerful and once illness invades, disease wants to be the victor. In the 3 years following 2016, there were entirely too many moments staring at my broken, defeated face in the mirror. It became a battle of self-will for survival. Fight for one more hour. And then one more. Suddenly, the years have passed, and I am a survivor. I am strong. Resilient. Empathetic. I know the depths of finding yourself swimming under current, constantly attempting one second above water. The undercurrent is unpredictable. Especially when it seems that you have the heaviest weights strapped to your ankles, bringing you further away from air. One breath. Come up for air. Back underwater. I know the depths of the deepest, darkest hole and fought my way out. I was brought back down and tested many times. I taught myself how to rebuild. The healing journeyalwaysstarts within ourselves. I had numerous resources and support that gave me an advantage, but the real work is internal. The treatment options I explored and utilized knew no bounds. When medications were not working, I researched and tried alternative treatment options, at the guidance of my doctor. When my doctor no longer served me, I found new doctors. No rock was left unturned in my fight to live. Absolute sheer will and leaning into the right resources is what allowed me to very slowly start rebuilding. I was building back up from the ashes. My mental health journey changed me, for the better. I found my voice and my purpose. I found my footing by honoring the pain, but embracing the beautiful parts of me that I discovered along the journey. I sat in the pain. I fought the hardest of fights. I did the work. The invisible scars of my battles are etched in every fiber of who I am, but they are what make me who I am today. I actively practice gratitude. I find and cultivate joy in the smallest ways. Shortly after I started healing mentally; I experienced what would become a lifelong journey battling another invisible illness: chronic pain. After navigating some of the most renowned hospital systems to help understand and treat my chronic pain - constantly shifting, pivoting and advocating for my care - I see how much those of us with invisible illnesses have to advocate to be taken seriously medical. Illnesses that cannot be seen require medical professionals to trust their patients. For women, symptoms that cannot be seen are entirely too often considered psychosomatic and in our heads. The onslaught of my chronic pain was similar to my diagnosis in 2016 with Major Depressive Disorder. Fast and furious. I lifted my 30 pound nephew one day, who I had lifted often for the first 1.5 years of his life, and that was the beginning of my chronic pain journey. Pain arrived suddenly and never went away. Soon after that incident, after being turned away by a medical provider, the bulging disc hit a nerve cavity that has now compromised my right leg. I drive with my left foot. I often limp. I wear a specialty belt and have a lumbar pillow that comes with me everywhere I go. I wear compression socks and take two baths a day with essential oils and bath salts. Despite these efforts, the nerve damage spread to both hands and I developed carpal tunnel out of nowhere. It was at the stage of needing surgery. And then it healed. To me, this is a testament to the strength of cultivating a strong, resilient mind. Nearly every single moment, awake or not, for the last 2 1/2 years, I am in varying degrees of pain. It is difficult to get the care you need for illnesses that cannot be seen to the outward eye. Despite that, doctors have shared that my body is in overdrive trying to heal itself. I owe that to the strength and perseverance of my mind. The mind that turned against me and told me I was not enough. That same mind now works for me to help me fight my new invisible illness that will also be with me for life. The work I did to heal myself through my mental anguish, the ability to finally sit and feel the mental turmoil, allowed me to climb out of my personal purgatory. The strength of your mind is humbling. We all hold pain and uncertainty differently. We all find strength, resilience, fight our internal battle, differently. I cannot tell you how many days I looked in the mirror, with puffy, swollen, defeated eyes and tears streaming down my face and literally, out loud, spoke to my reflection. I willed myself to keep fighting. To keep fighting. One more breath. One more moment. One more day. That was my life. And now, I have built a life that is beyond what I could have imagined. The person I was in those years of torment, is never far, but she grounds me. She reminds me to be grateful. To appreciate the small, simple moments. To persevere. She is also always in physical pain, but people do not believe what they cannot see. Laura Stepnicka is a Chicago native who lives with two invisible illnesses: depression and chronic pain. These invisible illnesses have changed every fiber of her being and she is very aware that her conditions are part of a lifelong journey of healing and growth. A journey she has fully embraced. Laura decided in early 2021 to make several lifestyle changes and moved to a one stoplight kind of town in Southwest Michigan, nestled in her log cabin in the trees with her sweetest foster fail, Piper.

    "data": "Lyzz, a 19 year old college student, has struggled with issues of weight, and ultimately with self-love, since childhood. Growing up, she watched her mother struggle with anorexia and endure multiple hospitalizations, feeding tubes, and seemingly endless suffering. She didn't want to end up this way, and promised herself she would never have an eating disorder. Despite her best intention, she developed Bulimia by the time she was a teenager. With her mother as a role model, she had no idea how to have a healthy relationships with food and her body. She didn't know how to love herself. But most of us struggle with issues of weight, even when we have had healthy role models. The pressure to be thin in our culture is enormous, especially for girls. Thin is considered better, and eating disorders are pervasive. According to the National Institutes of Health, about 10 million people in the U.S. have an eating disorder, and 90% of these are women. Approximately 4.5% of all American high school students reported in a recent survey that they'd vomited or used laxatives as a means to lose weight in the past 30 days, and approximately 4% of college-aged females have bulimia. According to the 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 35% of adolescent girls believed they were overweight, 60% were trying to lose weight. The vast majority of eating disorders go untreated. The numbers don't tell the whole story. To truly understand, we have to listen to those who have been directly effected. In Lyzz's words, \"To fully grasp that terror of an eating disorder would take much more than an hour long interview. The struggle for perfection is destructive and unbearable. Not only is this goal an impossible one, but the process is crippling and fatal. An eating disorder needs you to feel imperfect, unworthy, ugly, fat, disgusting, wrong, horrible. It strips you of your health, your self worth, your life, your soul. It blames you for everything that goes wrong and berates you if you can't fix it. You do not need to fix everything. It is not your fault. You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be the best you can be and not be afraid of who you are.

    "data": "This week in shadowing, we saw a coronary artery bypass. Because we shadow anesthesiology, we get to see the doctors and nurses set up. It is like setting up a show, everything must be done a certain way in a certain order. From inserting the catheter to carefully draping him so only the necessary areas of his body were exposed (in his case, his entire torso and his legs) and even unwrapping the towels a certain way, everything must be done just so and this was all before he was even cut open. A nurse got us step stools to stand on so we could see. The surgeons walked in at the last minute, taking the drill and the blade and adjusting the lights above. Then, they got to work and we stood there mesmerized until we had to go back to class. On the walk back to campus, I was in a daze. Upon reflecting on the experience, I found it to be simply bizarre to consider how the show and many others like it are continuing in operating rooms all over the world while we walk outside in the light of day. I couldn't stop thinking about the aftermath of the show. When I was in fourth grade, I was the wicked witch of the west for my class' version of the Wizard of the Oz and the face paint dyed my face green for three days after. The show was over but I felt like it was still happening to me. The man who underwent surgery today is going to wake up and hurt. But the surgeons had to break him to fix him. It was simply another day of work for these doctors. The anesthesiologists likely won't see the patient again, but the surgeons, the ones who weren't even there from start to finish, will be the ones to see him again when he wakes up. He will go home eventually and have a long, difficult recovery from this invasive surgery. I admired the patient's bravery and the surgeons' dexterity. I was amazed at the anesthesiologists' ability to compute complex body statistics against powerful medications. If I walked out in a daze and the man under the knife walks out in pain, how do the doctors walk out? Do they hurt, too, when they imagine what it feels like later to have the many sutures down your chest? Do they smile when they think about the years of life they added to his by just doing their job? In the operating room, they are all one show: surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, perfusionists, and even us undergraduate students. Outside, we are a fragmented entity that carries only our unique perspective of the show, combined with some input from their explanations. As a doctor, I will need to learn how to make sense of the show every day. To care for children with medical complexity, children whose needs do not fit inside a single diagnosis or a single medication, I will need to work in teams to put on good shows. But at the end of the day, when I will go home hopefully to my family, I wonder where I will put it. I am an empathic, emotional, and sensitive human being, but I am also driven and dedicated. I believe that I will learn how to integrate what I see of and the role I play in the show into who I am, without losing myself in the process. Hannah Todd is a rising senior at Rice University, where she is majoring in Spanish and Policy Studies with a minor in Medical Humanities. Additionally, she is concurrently pursuing her Master's in Public Health at the University of Texas and ultimately plans to attend medical school, which would allow her to integrate personal, academic, and professional experience into care for and policy regarding children with medical complexity.",

    "data": "By Effy Redman After a day of high school in eleventh grade, I stand in front of the stove in the small kitchen of the little house my family is renting in a grimy small town in upstate New York, a fork in my hand, and quickly eat leftover spaghetti with tomato sauce from the saucepan. I can't get enough. I am starving because I skipped lunch, hiding out in the high school library reading a glossy magazine instead of venturing into the cacophonous cafeteria with tables full of cliques I didn't fit into. The sensation of hunger became familiar, expected. I eat as much leftover pasta as I can, then I wash my hands and mouth at the kitchen sink. The reason I am self-conscious about eating at school is that I have a disability, a rare condition of facial paralysis called Moebius Syndrome, which makes eating, and other things, difficult for me. I cannot completely close my eyes or blink, and I speak a lot like a ventriloquist, without moving my lips. But I was raised to avoid talking about my disability. My parents taught me that it was preferable to act \"normal,\" like my four younger siblings. So, when I find myself hungry and alone in the high school library at lunchtime, instead of having compassion for the difficulties my disability causes me, I blame my isolation and deprivation on myself, on my apparent lack of social skills. After drying my hands and face on a ragged tea towel, I press Play on the boom box my parents keep on a high shelf. I listen to a cassette tape ofBelle and Sebastian, which one of my brother's cool friends recorded for him. I love this music. It makes me feel like there is hope for me, although I can't articulate where or how. Secretly, I wish I could hang out with my brother's friends. Many of them are Punks, with hair chopped into spikes and dyed cool colors, piercings, Doc Marten boots, and ironic lunchboxes. I see them sauntering down corridors in small groups, acting aloof and refined. I can't imagine them wanting to get to know me. In my final year as an undergraduate student at Bennington College, I write a Senior Reflective Essay. In the essay, I talk for the first time about having a disability, what that means to me, although I don't really know what it means to be disabled yet. Before this night, I have been silent about my disability, governed by its physical limitations yet too afraid of rejection to speak out. But now, after almost four years living away from home, where I was taught, however unintentionally, to act \"normal,\" I am ready. Distance gives me power. I remember sitting in my room in Stokes House on campus late at night, trying to write. My urge to procrastinate is so strong that I actually tie myself with a belt from a loop on my pants to my chair. It is late and the house is uncharacteristically quiet. I have a bottle of Dr. Pepper--my go-to when I have to pull an All-nighter--which I periodically drink from, loving the strangely familiar artificial flavor and the burn of carbonation in my mouth and throat. This is what I love about writing, this time alone to savor every sensation, to explore the corners of thought. I forget that I am tied to a chair, that I am slightly hungry, and bone tired. All there is is the keyboard beneath my fingertips and the bright white page in front of me. I write about immigrating from England to America at age thirteen right after having plastic surgery, I write about loss and grief, disability, looking and feeling different. Even while I write, I am realizing for the first time it is all true, and that is the scariest thing. The past year, I have developed romantic interest in several women and, although it will be three more years before I come out as a lesbian, these early stages of accepting my sexuality highlight with astounding clarity that I also need to come out as having a disability. In order to be myself, I need to know myself. I don't understand yet that this will be a journey. I probably shed a few tears. I definitely stare up at the white ceiling with its oddly shaped eaves more than once. When I finish the essay, just before dawn, I save my work, then crawl into bed fully clothed and pass out. It is the kind of sleep too deep for dreaming. I wish now I had known this was only the beginning of perceiving my disability, the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. What made me sit down then and begin that journey was that it had finally become impossible for me to pretend I was \"normal\" any longer. I was beginning to understand desire, and my desire involved not wanting to hide my true self.The memory of taking that first step toward self-acceptance amazes me, because it felt then like a conclusion. However, the opposite could not have been more true. It was, in fact, a point of origin. On my first day of teaching a Nonfiction Writing Workshop to undergraduate students at Hunter College in New York City, I asked my students to arrange their desks in a circle. It was 2016, winter, my fourth semester as a graduate student. The desks' metal legs scraping across the wooden floor sounded celebratory, like the beginning of something. As I had the previous semester on my first day teaching, looking around at my diverse student body, I felt almost maternal, a kind of responsibility new to me. Large windows at the classroom's far end looked out over Lexington Avenue, whose festive din of traffic would punctuate our bi-weekly gatherings. Once everyone was seated, I stood at my desk halfway round the circle and introduced myself. \"By the way,\" I said, \"I have a disability, a condition of facial paralysis that means I speak a lot like a ventriloquist.\" My new students were training their eyes on me with benevolent but acute focus. I continued. \"If you have difficulty understanding anything I say, feel free to ask, and I'll repeat myself.\" There was a moment of silence. Benign, thoughtful. I asked the students to take turns introducing themselves. In their expressions, I saw compassion, and esteem. I had been nervous in the days leading up to this class, but my new students were completely accepting of my differences. This, in turn, bolstered my confidence. I launched into the semester feeling like I had taken flight. The students' respect for me as an authority figure, a role model, inspired me to work harder than I ever had before. The experience of introducing my disability to my new Nonfiction students sticks out in my memory because it deepened my journey into writing my first book--a memoir of growing up with a physical disability. Even while I was trying to teach students how to write nonfiction, I was trying to figure out how to write nonfiction myself, as a graduate student. The layers of learning and teaching, receiving and giving, exposed new truths both in the classroom I walked into and onto the pages I typed. Whereas writing my disability memoir was, at that time, intensely private, casually describing my disability to my new students felt refreshingly public. I learned that each one of my students had a fierce drive to tell their story, too. I learned that my own story was more vulnerable than I had ever before imagined. For my thesis, I wrote about my body intimately, revealing details of my physical self I wouldn't even share with my therapist. My graduate school classmates and professors, to their credit, only ever gave feedback and critiques that reinforced the validity of my story's most vulnerable form. In a manner I never had before, I felt heard. Sometimes, riding the 6 train packed with commuters on my way to teach two early mornings each week, I felt the pressure of bodies crammed in around me like words crowding my mind before my hands released them onto the page. I had never felt more human. Some people gawk. They stare at me as though I am an oddity, a curiosity, because I have a facial difference. Occasionally, the gawkers are hostile, but this is very rare. Usually, people are simply wondering why I look different. I typically wait until I am getting to know someone to offer an explanation. I don't feel that I owe anyone one, not even you. I remember my best friend in middle school telling me that, when I joined the school, there were other students who disliked me due to my difference. I had to prove myself. My friend explained that she had decided to give me a chance. This was in England, where I was born. We were lying on the bright yellow floorboards in my bedroom, near the bay window. My friend was half Black, but we never talked about that. It didn't occur to me to ask her if she ever felt other, too. Our school was a tiny, private Christian school in inner city Manchester. We were both sheltered at home and exposed to the roughness of inner city living. She was one of many friends along the way who showed me true respect and unconditional love, which I would need in order to navigate becoming an adult. Friendship has always been my sanctuary from any hostility I might encounter in the world. People talk to me. What I mean is, people make themselves vulnerable to me. I think this is because I radiate vulnerability and receptivity. Regardless of what I think of the people exposing their stories to me, I am repeatedly moved by their vulnerability, by their trust that I won't judge them, even that I may help them. I have not always been nonjudgmental, though. During my first year of undergraduate college, I met a young woman who had cerebral palsy and used a walker. Though I wouldn't admit to it, I was repelled by her disability, by her looking different, and refused her offer of friendship. In her, I saw too much of myself for comfort. I lied to her when she invited me to see a play on campus with her, saying I would be busy. I will always regret this missed opportunity for connection. Several years ago, I spoke on the phone with a dear friend who had just broken up with her long-term boyfriend. She seemed most upset about all the time invested into the relationship. She was in Kentucky and I was in upstate New York, yet the conversation felt close. I told her I was sorry about what she was going through. I couldn't think of much else to say. My own romantic relationships so far had all been short-lived. I didn't have much basis for comparison. But I did understand personal loss. The loss of physical ability, the loss of childhood friends due to immigration, the loss of self. On some level, my friend knew this. And by inhabiting the moment centered in her loss, paradoxically, my own loss diminished, because of the comfort of the bond we shared. In the small city in upstate New York where I live, on a warm day this November, I walk down my street. I pass a large brick house with an old walker abandoned on the front lawn. This place is a community residence for adults with mental health diagnoses. And, for a couple weeks in 2017, I lived there. What I haven't told you yet is that, at age twenty-five, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. There is scientific research proving that Moebius Syndrome, and the inability to smile, is linked to depression. Thus, I believe my mental health diagnosis is essentially a component of my physical disability. Living with it, including several nervous breakdowns, has at times disrupted my life and relationships. That's how I wound up in the community residence five years ago, just half a block from the beautiful apartment where, quite by coincidence, I now live independently. I pause for a moment on the sidewalk near the community residence and study the walker. It is perched on a slight hillock in the lawn so it tilts precariously to the side, as though pushed. The sun warms my face. In the abandoned walker, I see neglect, carelessness, fragility. At forty, having lost everything then rebuilt my life a couple times, I can say that I am happy. This happiness is more of a baseline quiet satisfaction than anything ecstatic. My bipolar symptoms have been in remission for almost five years, my career is flourishing, and I have cultivated a diverse, supportive community. That said, there are still days when I feel emotionally or physically awful. But even then, I am conscious of being in a good place, a place where I can both work and rest. I cannot take the luxury of peace for granted. A large part of settling where I live has been discovering the local LGBTQ+ community and connecting with fellow queer people. Identity, I think, cannot be limited to a single title. It is essentially intersectional, because humanity is endlessly multi-faceted. For example, I am a lesbian neurodivergent immigrant with a physical disability. But maybe even that example is overly simplified. Doesn't true identity shrink when we attempt to simply label it? Although there are some knowns in my future--a book contract, a job contract, community events--I think of it as a blank page I am trying to write onto. Some days, I see the page clearly, it all makes sense. Other days, I need to sit back and stare out my windows holding a cup of coffee, waiting for insight, or at least the motivation to get up off the sofa and start something. Although control is essentially an illusion, I do feel more control over my life than I ever before have, because I have autonomy, which, for me, manifests as the freedom to make my own choices within the fabric woven from a diverse, supportive community. I have access to both the space to breathe and the human connections that help bring my journey to life. As each day unfolds, I remember that reality can be a gift.

    "data": "A Q&A with Diane Atwood, Founder ofCatching Health,and theConversations about AgingPodcast Val Walker Diane Atwood was a health reporter at WCSH-TV for more than twenty years, and later a marketing and public relations manager for Mercy Hospital in Portland, Maine. She is now a full-time blogger and podcaster on health issues, specializing on aging and isolation. Diane Atwood is the founder ofCatching Health, and the podcast,Conversations about Aging. She describes her mission as \"Health reporting that makes a difference.\" Introduction Diane Atwood is a master interviewer, profiler, and journalist, well-known in Maine for her deep and richly detailed conversations with her interviewees on her blog and podcasts. I was honored that she recently interviewed me about the release of my new book,400 Friends and No One to Call. Indeed, it was Diane's interview with me that inspired me to interviewher. She was, quite frankly, a wise and seasoned interviewer who could teach me and others about her craft. I have always found profiling and interviewing people to be a fine art--particularly if we could capture the essence of that individual through their stories revealed through thoughtful and leisurely paced conversations. I have a story to tell about how Diane interviewed me, as it sheds light on how she works her magic in these times of rushed and fragmented conversations in our digital age. On March 18th, the day of my interview, everyone in the Northeastern US was scrambling to prepare for their COVID-19 lock down. I was in the throes of adjusting to (and grieving) the drastic loss of dozens of speaking engagements, book signings and classes--indeed, the loss of my business-- and a terrible time to release a new book! I hardly wanted to be interviewed at all, as I still had not had time to wrap my mind around how COVID-19 had radically changed the meaning of my book, if not the magnitude of my book's message about loneliness and isolation. I didn't feel prepared to speak confidently about breaking out of isolation because I was clueless about how I would pay my rent next month. How dare I speak as an expert on social isolation and loneliness when I felt cut off from my clients, networks, colleagues, and friends who were all as isolated as I was? But within minutes of our phone call, Diane put me at ease, welcoming my book into the world, inviting me to tell my story--the good, the bad, and the lonely--about why I wrote my book and what my message meant during these pandemic times. Her steady and friendly approach, gently probing, permitted me to trust her judgment and guidance as we delved into profound storytelling. Diane's deep exploration helped me grasp a new perspective of my book's message in times of social distancing, giving me a clear vision of how my book was going to help people survive isolating times. Her Q&A with me etched out the ways my life's work was meaningful and vital at this time, and I am deeply grateful for her gift as an interviewer, profiler and storyteller. Her interview with me left me with a beautifully unique portrait of my essence and my life's purpose, not just a description of my book. With this first-hand experience of being her interviewee, I can attest to how Diane shares her gift with older seniors who are eager to have their life story told and their vibrant essence celebrated and shared. Her podcast series,Conversations about Aging, reflects her passion and dedication. A Q&A with Diane Atwood Val: What got you interested in doing interviews with seniors in their homes? Diane:A couple of years ago, I went to a conference about the isolation and loneliness of seniors in rural Maine to report on this topic. I already knew that loneliness was deeply entrenched in rural society. After attending the conference, alarmed about seniors living alone in the empty, sparsely populated landscapes of Maine, I felt a call to visit seniors in their homes--just to engage them in conversation, storytelling and reminiscing. Perhaps I could help them feel less lonely this way. It was clear seniors needed meaningful and personalized conversation, and they longed to share their life experiences with others. I decided to start a podcast where I could post interviews with people over age sixty, calling itConversations about Aging. And further, having deep, long conversations for up to two hours might be particularly rewarding--mutually speaking. Diane with interviewee, Wayne Newell Val: What do you especially enjoy about interviewing seniors and creating podcasts of their stories? Diane:I love it when I ask someone, 'Tell me about your life,' and suddenly our conversation takes on a life of its own! Our conversations are adventures, and, as the one asking the questions, I have the power to steer the adventure, like a guide through their exploration of their life. My passion for interviewing people is to help them find meaning in their stories. This is how I feel I am making a difference. I believe people are starving to share, on a personal level, what matters about their lives. I love to see their eyes light up, and then our conversation deepens, bringing their past up to the present. After I have arrived at their home and settled into asking questions, I have often heard them remark, 'Nobody's ever asked me these kinds of questions before.' They usually are surprised at first. But they appreciate my interest in them, and they seem to like that I'm not afraid to ask them personal questions that typically didn't fit daily chatter. Val: What kinds of questions do you ask? Diane:One of my favorite things to ask is, 'What makes it a good day for you?' I've heard answers such as, 'What makes a good day for me is just to hear the birds.' Or, 'That I have someone to show my pictures to.' Or, 'That I have another day to look forward to.' And so many are grateful to see me, and tell me, 'Thank you for travelling so far to hear my story.' Another question I ask is, 'Do you feel lonely?' It's astounding the range of answers I get. I have found that isolation is not always the cause of loneliness. You can have lots of people around and plenty to do but still feel isolated. Or you can live days and weeks completely alone and enjoy your own company alongside the comfort of nature and animals. One woman in her 90s who lives alone in rural Maine remarked, 'I enjoy my own company surrounded by beautiful memories.' She loves her quiet life of solitude. On the other hand, I spoke with a man in an assisted living community who had plenty to do every day, but still felt lonely. His one, painful reason for being lonely was that he could not interact with his kids as often as he'd like. I believe loneliness has more to do with a lack of meaningful connection in our lives. Val:Yes, I so agree that meaningful connections are essential as we age. What do you believe fosters meaningful connections? Diane:First of all, just look at all the losses in their lives. Loss of friends, family, work--and all the ways we have maintained structure throughout our lives, especially through rituals and routines--these have disappeared. They have lost their patterns of behavior with their daily routines, no matter how small. Perhaps, they had been meeting at their churches, their local coffee shops with their friends, taking daily walks with their dog in their neighborhood park, going to regular events such as birthdays, anniversaries, holidays. Their rituals have provided meaningful connections for them for decades. But suddenly, those rituals and routines are gone, and they must somehow find a replacement, even in an assisted living community or nursing home. Or in your own home without being able to access what you used to do. But here's the most tragic part: It seems no one is interested in your story these days, in our rushed, distracted society. It seems there is never the right time to share your story because there is a lack of rituals and routines that can provide the structure to have long and rich conversations. Seniors often lose these opportunities just to tell their stories, to have the time and undivided attention without being hurried or interrupted. You can have lots of people around and plenty to do but still feel isolated, just because our lives feel meaningless. Val: Besides asking good questions, what are other ways you spark conversations? Diane:I think the mere fact that I am interested in someone's story provides the most potent spark. For instance, I had a blast with a Passamaquoddy Indian man named Wayne Newell, whom I interviewed in Princeton, Maine, where he lives with his wife Sandy on the Indian Township reservation. (Wayne prefers to call himself Passamaquoddy Indian rather than native American.) Wayne, age seventy-seven, is blind and dependent on oxygen from a tank. When I visited him, he was recovering from pneumonia, but said he was so looking forward to our conversation he didn't want to cancel. He was worried about his voice not being a strong as usual, but we ended up talking for about two hours. I was captivated by his stories of growing up on the reservation, the many challenges he has faced, and how he was able to get a Master's degree from Harvard. People are often eager to share not only what they have accomplished, but also what they are still accomplishing. For example, Ernie DeRaps, who's in his 90s, was once a lighthouse keeper. When he retired at age eighty, he began painting lighthouses. He showed me his collection down in his basement. It was an honor to spend time viewing his paintings. Every single painting of each lighthouse had its own story. Ernie DeRaps Val: I notice with your podcast,Conversations about Aging, you typically describe in great detail the landscape of where your interviewee lives. I find that interesting--as if the place where the person lives is part of what defines the individual's character. Diane:Yes, I always describe the landscape of where we are in the podcasts. Wayne, for example, spoke about the lake by his home. Listeners of his podcast can learn of his sense of identity through this lake, his connection to this particular place, his sense of history and belonging through the world of this lake. Or through stories of his life on a reservation. Val: It seems the detailed and colorful descriptions of where your interviewees live help to segue so beautifully into their life stories. Diane:And here in Maine, in rural settings, it is essential to let your interviewee know that you are noticing these things about their home, about their town, about the woods or the lake or the area. It not only helps them feel comfortable with you, it is a sign of respect and honor. Val: Do your interviewees like to have their story shared as a podcast and published? Diane:Not necessarily--some do, and some don't. Sometimes they don't respond at all to their podcast once it is up on my website. Some of my interviewees are satisfied just with our conversation itself. One of my interviewees, Leona Chasse, told me, 'I enjoyed this so much--just the conversation.' Val: But what a tremendous gift you are giving them, Diane. They are so fortunate to have you there with them. Diane:This work gives my life meaning. I love synthesizing all the disparate information from my visits to their homes and from their memories. Gathering all the information from our interactions, stories, photos, and natural landscapes--somehow, I try to capture the essence of that person. Val:And you do that, brilliantly. Thank you for sharing your wisdom with Health Story Collaborative today. We are all storytellers here and you have helped us appreciate even more the power of harnessing our stories.

    "data": "By Regina Beach I have so many feelings around living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). There's the grief of the life I thought I'd live that will likely never materialize. There's the sadness of feeling helpless and incompetent at basic things, taking forever to do tasks like cooking, cleaning or getting ready for the day. I need support for the errands and minutiae of daily life that I used to take for granted.I also feel a lot of shame: over not making it to the bathroom in time again . . . and again. There's the shame, (or is it regret?) of not getting my symptoms checked out when they first emerged. Would I have been able to stem the tide of profound disability with more hasty intervention? There's also the guilt I feel for relying on my husband to take care of me. He does the lion's share, earns the lion's share, and takes care of the house, carefully planning with me in mind. We were barely married when I started having symptoms. I regret he only knew me for a few years in my old body that could hike and bike and run and dance.I have never been so aware and yet so unaware. I stepped on a shoe in the living room yesterday when I came home from physiotherapy and fell on the floor, totally unaware of my surroundings, where I was standing. I do that with my own legs; sometimes I forget they're crossed or don't know what I'm stepping on.I'm also hyper aware: of the pins and needles in my feet, of the way I walk and the stares that accompany me if I'm in public on my own. I'm better able to steel myself when I'm with family or friends. I'm aware of my bladder, worry about my bowels, but awareness doesn't always equate to control.I feel frustrated not knowing if I'll have a good day or a bad one when I get up. Will I be able to walk well or hardly at all? The inconsistency is maddening and sends my type A plan-ahead brain into a tailspin of myriad eventualities to plan for: What if I feel like this? What If I need that? What if this happens? I can't be spontaneous anymore.I feel anxious about the future. I know there are people who stabilize, even improve their symptoms, shrink their lesions, live with more or less benign MS, but will I be one of them? My symptoms have been with me a long time and with every passing year I feel like recovery is just that much more out of reach. Will I deteriorate? Will I need constant care? Will my cognition fail me? My aphasia worries me the most. Forgetting names of people, of companies, of household items. I love words; they have been my constant companion. Who will I be if they run out one by one?I also feel compassion in a way I never have before, for the elderly, those with visible and invisible disabilities, and those whose brains are wired differently. I used to be strict and unrelenting. I was in the camp of \"do more, try harder, work more and surely anything will be surmountable.\" I've softened, admitting some mountains just can't be climbed.I'm grateful for the good days, the community I'm developing, and the incredibly diverse group of people MS has brought into my life. I have a global community united by technology and membership in a club no one wanted to belong to. I've met people all over the globe who have introduced me to a healthier lifestyle. Even if I am so sick in some ways, I'm eating better than I ever have, managing my stress better than I ever have, and thinking of myself first in ways I never have before.I'm in a better headspace than I was a year ago. It's been four years since I felt the first tingles in my feet. I was a real mess emotionally for a long time. Anxiety and depression are now recognized as MS symptoms and not just secondary conditions that often coexist with the disease. I used to feel a lot of bitterness and resentment toward everyone with MS who can still walk, who can hold their bladder, who has seemingly milder cases than I do, but who's to say really what's actually worse?A year ago I would have struggled to find the silver lining. My partner has lived up to his promise that we'll still see the world, just in a different way and at a different pace. He's promised to stick with me, even when - and perhaps especially when - I'm difficult to love. I'm sure he has a lot of emotions around MS, too. Helplessness, anger, feelings of unfairness, discomfort, but he has never been upset with me, never blamed me, never accused me of faking or exaggerating a symptom. I know others with partners who are less generous in spirit around this ever in-flux disease.I know that my feelings will change. There are people who say getting sick was the best thing that happened to them, that they got clear on their priorities, changed their jobs, dove into their bucket list, are healthier and happier than they've ever been. I'm not one of them. I'm not there yet and I don't know if I'll ever get there. But I don't think that they're the toxically positive Pollyannas I use to think of them as. Now I think they truly believe what they say; maybe they have found the needle in the haystack, the diamond in the rough, made their own pitcher of lemonade. Maybe someday I will, too.

    "data": "Last week, I interviewed Sarah Baker, a Cambridge based writer, mother and independent radio producer, about her recent article, \"Unraveling My Childhood Asthma: Did motherhood Cure it?\", published on WBUR's Commonhealth Blog on May 9, 2014. I was drawn to this article because it so beautifully portrays the complex process of integrating illness and loss into one's life, and how writing can be a part of this. As Sarah puts it, writing this piece was like bringing her interior world and her exterior world together in public, perhaps for the first time, and this was a powerful experience. Read Sarah's piece, and listen to the audio recording of the interview. Sarah is eloquent, honest and brave. She has lessons to teach all of us. Stay tuned for her memoir! Listen to audio here: Photo credit: Susan Lapides Transcript of Dr. Annie Brewster's interview with Sarah Baker: Dr. Annie Brewster: So I'm here today with Sarah Baker, freelance writer, mother and a independent radio producer. I wanted to talk with her about an article that she recently wrote called \"Unraveling My Childhood Asthma: Did Motherhood Cure it?\" which was published on WBUR's Commonhealth Blog on May 9th. I love this article and I think it really is right along the lines of what Health Story Collaborative is about; trying to harness the healing power of stories, so I wanted to talk to you about the process of writing it and what came out of it. I guess as a first question, I was really struck in reading it by all the different roles that asthma played in your life. It set you apart, it called attention to you in life when you might not have otherwise gotten attention, it brought out \"sassy pants\" which I loved and it was also a constant in your life in the midst of what was otherwise chaotic. So it served many roles, both positive and negative, it seems. I'm wondering if you can speak to that and the different roles that it played in your life. Sarah Baker: I agree with everything you just said. I was a kid who went through a lot of trauma early and my body responded in a way that maybe my brain didn't know how to. I couldn't breathe. I think my asthma was a reaction to the stress. My mother had died, we moved all the time, and I lived with all of these different families. That is very stressful. Maybe not being able to say out loud, \"I hate this\" or whatever my feelings might have been. I wheezed and that was where my stress went, to my asthma. I read Joan Didion's essay, \"In Bed,\" about her struggling with migraines and it made me think about my asthma and I started to write the piece. It was through writing that I began to notice how my asthma had been a constant in my life, how it had been representative of the stress. This is somewhat new to me--where I've thought about my asthma from this perspective, as a forty-six year old. As a child I was just trying to survive. Annie Brewster: I'm really interested in what you said about that you never really consciously thought about this until you started to write about it. I'm really fascinated with the process of storytelling and how that sort of helps move somebody from one place or another. So, can you speak to the process that you went through in writing this and how that helped you and what it meant then to put it out there in a public way and get feedback on it; what that was like for you and what did it take to get to a place where you felt ready to take that on as a writing project? Sarah Baker: I remember a number of years ago when I started writing, a friend of mine who is a successful writer said, \"write what's raw\" so I always try to write what hits a chord in my heart. So writing about my childhood and writing about my mother's death is what I tend to write about. This was the first time I wrote about my asthma and it was hard to write about it because I don't have a lot of memory. I had to interview my Dad, I had to do some research, and I had to relive the trauma. I just kept working at [the story] and sometimes felt a little sick after writing but I just kept working. I usually write ten drafts before I show it to any one. I showed it to my husband and he reacted positively. I showed it to a class that I was in and to my teacher and they responded positively. I thought maybe I've struck something here. Then the story sat in my computer for a year; it did. And it was after I started taking a class about the book I'm working on that I decided to send it out. Maybe the year allowed it to percolate so it didn't feel as scary. Once it was out there, the feedback was great. People came out of the woodwork. People that knew me as a kid, that knew me when I had a collapsed lung or people who knew me as a kid who didn't know any of this. They were all very moved by the piece. That was very powerful. My mother-in-law said, \"It's like you've come out\"...my interior world had been different from my exterior world; people might see me as this successful or...successful is the wrong word but kind of, um...what is the word I'm looking for? Annie Brewster: Together... Sarah Baker: Together... you know, with a lovely house and a great husband and wonderful children and all of that; I have a wonderful life but I had this crazy history that people didn't know about so all of a sudden they know this side of me. That has been really powerful. Annie Brewster: How come people didn't know about that part of you? What kept you from sharing it before this essay? Sarah Baker: Well, I think that people at the time knew about it because they could see me being sick but then I think I just put everything, all of these pieces of me, on the back burner and I just kept moving forward, trying to almost erase the past. I think that is probably what happened. Annie Brewster: Do you feel like there was ever any shame in it? Sarah Baker: That is a really interesting question. I don't know. Maybe it felt like a weakness or something that I had to put aside? I never even brought it up. I didn't even think about my asthma really until I was writing this piece, thirteen years after my asthma went away. It's only now that I'm beginning to think about my relationship to my asthma and why I might not have talked about it for all of those years. I don't know. Annie Brewster: It's always a really slow process that we don't necessarily know that is going on or sort of coming into a place where you're ready to write about it or integrate it into your life but, can you name sort of what might have changed in you that made you feel like \"alright, I'm ready to write about it\"? Or was it all unconscious? Sarah Baker: The Joan Didion piece gave me permission. I thought, \"she wrote so powerfully about something that nobody sees\"--migraines--and even though I don't have migraines, I don't suffer from them thankfully, the story gave me sympathy for people who do suffer. I know a lot of people who suffer from migraines. The story made me think differently. I felt with my asthma...I feel when I write any of these personal stories...I have to get over a hurdle at the beginning but then I begin to feel, we are all struggling in our own way, whether it's with loss or trauma or illness or whatever it might be so if I can tell a story, maybe a few people out there in the world can say, \"Yes, that was me, too.\" A number of people responded to my story on the Commonhealth blog, on my blog, and NPR ran it on their blog with their own stories of childhood asthma. It just kind of adds to the conversation of life. I used to feel ashamed about writing these pieces. \"Who's going to care?\" \"Why would anyone care about my life\"? But I've learned that these stories do resonate. I'm drawn to personal stories whether in books, memoirs or articles... I thought, \"Why shouldn't I be a part of this dialogue?\" I have a kooky story. I think I can tell it with a little bit of humor or something that will make people keep reading. So, I'm just going for it. Annie Brewster: Do you feel like writing about it has changed your relationship with other people? Sarah Baker: Absolutely. Even though I'd written it a while ago, when it came out it was very raw for people. One friend, for instance, stopped me on the street. She's a therapist, and she said, \"I'm going to think very differently about the kids I treat that have asthma...a lot of it is from the stress of their homes.\" Because I wrote the story a while ago, by the time it was published, I was closed off to it. But for people who had just read it, it was still very raw. It was hard for me sometimes to know how to respond because the enthusiasm and the kindness and the overwhelming support was so powerful. I didn't always know how to respond. I just tried to be gracious. Annie Brewster: Did your children know all this about your asthma and your life and the struggles and your mother's death before you wrote this or was it new for them to read it, or did they read it? Sarah Baker: They haven't read it yet. I'm wondering when to show it to them. They've heard bits and pieces of my story but they haven't read any of my writing yet. I was just thinking today about when I would show it to them. I showed it to my nephew, my brother's son, who is a junior in college. He responded so thoughtfully. I think the article helped him understand his father's story, and helped him understand me. I will show it to my kids when I feel they're ready. Annie Brewster: What do you think it would take for them to be ready? Sarah Baker: Well I don't want to scare them. I don't know...maybe I am underestimating them. I have a fourteen year old and an eleven year old. Maybe after this interview, I will go home and show it to them and see what happens. Annie Brewster: That would be interesting. I'm interested in the motherhood piece and I was really moved by your story of your mother's illness and her death and how that affected you. I'm wondering if you can speak to the interplay between that loss and that pain before the loss and your asthma. What was the interaction? Stress you named already but was there more that...it's all so woven together and complex I know, but how do you think those things played off each other? Sarah Baker: I'm only beginning to learn about that. But I think they absolutely played off each other. In my piece, I quote Senesa who said he'd had a lot of illnesses but asthma was the worst because it was like \"rehearsing death.\" It's intense to think about that. I had asthma before she died. She got sick when I was three and I had my first attack when I was eighteen months old so I had already had it. But to have my mother die and then to have this disease that's \"rehearsing death\" where I couldn't breathe; there has got to be a link there. I don't understand completely. I am still exploring it. Annie Brewster: Yes. I was struck by the image of the two of you sort of in parallel, in different hospitals, but across the city from one another, so apart but together in an interesting way. Sarah Baker: Yes. It must have been impossible for my father who had a full time job in the navy and had to commute between these two hospitals. My mother was at John's Hopkins because they were doing cutting edge research on brain tumors. She actually lived a lot longer than they expected... and then I went to Bethesda Naval Hospital across the state of Maryland. We lived in Virginia. Sometimes my Dad had to drive over 100 miles a day going between the two hospitals. Right before my mother died, my father was in the hospital for an ulcer. That's not surprising. I had been in the hospital for an asthma attack and my mother was actually, she had been at home and was actually put in my hospital, so she could be near everybody. That's when she died. But I never saw her. Annie Brewster: I'm just sort of talking off the top of my head here but, in hearing you speak and sort of thinking about this image of \"rehearsing for death\" and her death, do you think in any way that your asthma worked to keep you sort of connected to your mother in a way? Or does that not feel like it fits? Sarah Baker: I'm learning a lot about that now and I think absolutely. I think when you lose a mother or a parent early in your life and you don't go through the grieving process, I think you become very loyal to the sadness and I think there is a part of you that unconsciously, because you're little and you don't have the words for it, says, \"I'm going to stay loyal. I'm never going to be as happy as you were.\" And so, yes... I absolutely think that when you lose somebody when you're little, you make these silent pacts with them to stay loyal to the sadness, to stay loyal to what they went through...to keep them on a pedestal and to hold them in this special place in your heart. Annie Brewster: Do you think sort of unconsciously maybe you would have felt like getting better and not having asthma anymore would be a betrayal of sorts? Sarah Baker: It's risky to say any of this because I did have asthma and I wouldn't want to take away from anybody that does have asthma. But, I had a lot of trauma and maybe this was one of my ways of staying loyal to her. I don't know. This is all speculation. It's just curious now as an adult when I don't have asthma and it went away so quickly once I had stability...I'm just now looking at these questions and wondering, what went on really? Annie Brewster: I think you're right to say that you don't want to take away from anyone who has asthma, and I was wondering that and I was going to ask you, what is your thought on what role two individuals play in creating their own illness and to what degree are we responsible for that? I know that's a big question and it's really complex but... Sarah Baker: I don't have any authority to answer that question... I can only tell my own story. This is all speculation. My parents were both smokers; it was a time when people smoked. We lived in a house with wall-to-wall carpeting and you know, it could have been that my environment changed, I don't know exactly and I'm reluctant to say that we create our own illnesses. I'm just looking at my own circumstances and wondering. My son has asthma but it's minor and we manage it. He's never been hospitalized. Maybe, my asthma would've been like his. Maybe I would've had it but it would've been milder. Annie Brewster: I absolutely agree with you, I am very reluctant to say that anyone causes anything but I think it's a complex interplay between genetics, the predisposition that we have and our environment and our stress and our psychosocial circumstances and all of that. So, of course it's impossible to say. And sometimes I think there is just bad luck and that's a factor. Can you say how maybe having lived through both asthma and your mother's death may have changed the way you mother today? Sarah Baker: Both absolutely inform my parenting They inform everything I do, not consciously maybe; but, I know I have a fear of loss. Also, I had such a crazy childhood that I've always wanted to make sure that my children have a happy, joyful, stable childhood. I've made a lot of choices to make sure of that--sometimes even putting motherhood in front of other choices that I might have made. Annie Brewster: Are there parts of you that you love that you feel came to you because of these difficult experiences in your life? Things that you're proud of; strengths that have come out of that? Sarah Baker: Well, I do think that I have resilience and grit (two buzzwords these days). I wouldn't wish my childhood on anyone but I did have to learn how to cope and I learned how to be around all sorts of different people and circumstances. They're positives and negatives to that. I think it made me flexible but then it kind of...you reach a point where you become inflexible because you're tired of always trying to accommodate other people. So, there are positives and negatives. Annie Brewster: I love the image of you're singing and the sort of juxtaposition of the asthma and the singing and the different ways of using your lungs and your breath. I thought that was very beautiful. Can you tell us more about your singing and how that feels to be taking voice lessons? Sarah Baker: In the beginning it was unbelievable what a bad singer I was. I was inhibited; I couldn't even get the sound out. It took a long time. After four to six months, my teacher realized that I was probably a little tone deaf so then she did some ear training. Slowly, I've gotten more comfortable and I've been able to access the different parts of my breathing and my voice. Recently, she told me I could sing soprano. What a shocker! Annie Brewster: Do you feel like somehow, I mean I'd be afraid to take voice lessons, it takes a lot of courage. Do you trust yourself more now? Is allowing yourself to sing...does it have anything to do with trust or letting go? Can you speak to that? Sarah Baker: Absolutely, it has to do with finding your voice literally and feeling that your voice matters in the world and that you're not embarrassed by it. My first year of singing lessons was about quieting my inner critic. The one that says, \"No one wants to hear this.\" Same thing with the writing, you know. My singing teacher was so gentle and kind. She just kept saying, \"Don't criticize yourself, and just sing. I want you to sing loudly and I want you to just go for it and don't think about anything other than that.\" It was through that process, of just going for it and being completely uninhibited, that the sound started to come out. Annie Brewster: That's amazing. What made you decide to take the voice lessons? Sarah Baker: There are so many opportunities to sing in the world and I was never singing. I lacked confidence. I wanted to sing at school assemblies, or birthday parties, or wherever, and feel good about it. So, I just went for it. Annie Brewster: Do you think that writing about all of this and in a public way has changed your relationship with your father? Is his still living? Sarah Baker: Yes, he is still living Annie Brewster: And your brother, you said you had a brother. Do you have any other siblings? Sarah Baker: Yes. I have a brother. I also have a half brother and half sister. Annie Brewster: So, has writing altered those relationships? Sarah Baker: Yes. I think for my brother who has his own business and works very hard, I can write these stories and send them to him. He can relive with me some of this trauma that we just had to run as fast as we could away from. My writing has made me closer to him. I've given my dad some of my pieces, not all of them. I'm worried that he might feel hurt by them. One piece I gave him, he responded by saying, \"Well, I actually didn't think that paragraph was accurate.\" It's all perspective. It was accurate for me and so, I'm sensitive about showing things to him because I'm protective of him but, I also...It's through my writing that I've gotten to know my own story. I'm not blaming anybody at all. I'm not trying to judge them. I'm just trying to tell the story. I'm getting more confident with showing him my work and not worrying. I have some essays, though, that nobody has seen except for classmates or very close friends. I worry that people will be offended by them. Annie Brewster: Tell me about the memoir you're writing. Sarah Baker: I had written a bunch of essays like the asthma story and realized I had about forty-five pages. In them, I kept telling the story of my mother and her death over and over but in different ways. Then I read the book \"Wave\" which is a spectacular memoir by Sonali Deraniyagala. She's Sri Lankan. She lost her whole family in the 2004 tsunami. It's an unbelievable book. After I read it (it took me two and a half hours and it was painful to read but it was so powerful), I thought she's done an incredible service for the rest of us. I learned what she went through, and how she came out and I thought, \"Maybe I can write a book that is a legacy of loss.\" The story of a little girl who has lost her mother and her father who, as I say was \"out to sea\" (because he was out to sea, literally), and who lived with her relatives - how I carried that loss into my adulthood. I want to tell a story of how we carry loss and what happens when it's not tended to properly. Annie Brewster: So, it's a giving back of sorts. Sarah Baker: Yes. Annie Brewster: You articulate - you say reading \"Wave\"-I want to go out and read it now-it tapped into something in you and it's that giving back piece that I'm interested in. What do you think, I mean it moved you, but what else did it offer you? Can you articulate that? Sarah Baker: First, it is absolutely beautifully written so it is a great example of writing and structure. But more than that...she lost her parents, her children, and her husband and I just don't know how anybody could ever survive from that. She paints this picture of how Elizabeth Kubler Ross in many ways was wrong. I don't know if wrong is the right word but The Five Stages of Grief, you don't pass through them very easily. They are messy and they are morphing and in this book you see that. The other part of the book that was powerful for me was that she had a real community to support her. She had friends and relatives there to take care of her and it took a long time. It took a long time to even think about her family that she lost. And then, how she very carefully pieced it back together with memory where all of a sudden she could go back to her house in London and all of a sudden she could begin to think about her husband and then she could begin to think about her parents. That's the way grief works. It doesn't happen all at once; it comes gradually and in an agonizing way. She describes it so beautifully and accurately. I wouldn't say that at the end of the book that she, you know you never recover, but she's living her life and she's written this beautiful book and she's helping people in the world who have experienced loss. It is brave of her to have written the book. Annie Brewster: Absolutely. I also think it is really helpful to see an example of the truth, which is that it's messy, it's gradual; you don't always know that you're going through the process when you're going through it. It's not clean and I think that is freeing to other people who are in the midst of it. Sarah Baker: Absolutely, yes. A family rents her parent's house, for example. They move in and she can't stand that they're living there. She goes to their house at night and rings the doorbell and runs away. She torments them. This is a woman who is a professor at Columbia now, I believe. I mean she's incredibly educated and that is where grief took her. It took her to terrible depths. She drank. I mean she had a real drinking problem for a while. She really scraped hell; she scraped the bottom. Maybe it was what you asked earlier about being loyal to death, to the deceased. Maybe she thought, \"I'm not going to have a better life than you are. I'm going to live an equally bad life.\" Maybe she was unconsciously creating a hell for herself to show her loyalty to the people she loved and lost. Annie Brewster: That's well said. Also, I think it's so helpful to see the movement; that you can hit those depths of horribleness and then move out of it and I think that is always so helpful to see when you're in the midst of something. That you're not going to get stuck there, that you're going to pass through. So, do you feel like \"Sassy Pants\" is back? Sarah Baker: \"Sassy Pants\"... Yes! I feel like Sassy Pants is... It is kind of sassy to publish an article about my asthma I think and send it out to the world. You've got to be a little bit sassy to put yourself out there like that. Maybe you have to be a little sassy to sing, especially when you're going for those high notes. So, yes, I think Sassy Pants is back and she's breathing well. Annie Brewster: I love thinking about this image, again, the singing, I just think it is such a joyful thing and it is so freeing. I love this image of you swaying with the music, with the sound bursting out and it feels really hopeful. I'm wondering, do you feel like you're at some sort of transition point where you're more free to dream about the future and what it holds and letting yourself deserve these things...does that feel accurate? And if so, what are the things you're dreaming about? What lies ahead for you? Sarah Baker: I'm getting there for sure and I think I'm dreaming about being able to... I never even thought I'd be able to write; I didn't think I knew how. I learned how to write in my forties. I took a grammar class. I started at the beginning. I had been an editor, I think I have an ear for language. But, I had never written a story before. It must be about my forties--you start to look at your life differently and see what you want to get done. I have just gotten comfortable thinking about myself as a writer and actually believing that my writing resonates and that it is worthwhile to write and publish. So, my dream is to write this book, to be able to work through all of these different chapters of my life that are hard to work through and figure out a way to tell it so that maybe my story can help other families or other children out there who also suffer from a loss, like the one that I did. That's one dream. My other dream is to be able to be present--to be able to feel the goodness that is all around me because I'm absolutely surrounded by goodness but I don't always feel it. So my dream is to really see what that is like--to feel present all of the time. That would be amazing. Annie Brewster: Awesome. I'm excited to read your memoir. Thank you. Sarah Baker: Thank you.",

    "data": "My mysterious symptoms began when I was 11 years old. I liked to play soccer, create art projects, and ride bikes with friends to White Hen to buy candy. I was the student council class president. I was also as pale as a ghost, barely weighed 70 pounds, and continually missing school because I was sick. High fevers, headaches, and chills--that was my deal. The pediatrician repeatedly told my parents, not me, that I had the flu. After almost a year of recurring flu, my parents wondered if I was being misdiagnosed and sought a second opinion. I remember being nervous as I overheard phone conversations my mom was having, asking friends for pediatrician recommendations, wondering what was wrong with me. After one visit, this new pediatrician didn't think I had the flu, admitted he didn't know what was wrong, suspected migraines, and sent us to an allergist to do sinus testing. And so my medical journey began. From specialist to specialist, until an infectious disease physician referred us to a gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy and, there, my atypical presentation of Crohn's Disease was discovered. Crohn's Disease causes inflammation in the lining of the digestive tract, it can be painful and debilitating, and while there are therapies to reduce symptoms, there is no known cure. By the time my Crohn's was diagnosed, I'd missed a ton of 6th grade and the one month session of overnight camp that I'd already packed my duffle to attend: T-shirts, shorts, sneakers, swimsuits, beach towels, extra long sheets for the bunk beds, tennis racket, cassette player walkman and headphones, berry flavored lip gloss, and carefully selected stationery to write friends and family at home. I remember the morning of the camp send-off. It was a warm, clear, sunny day. I went to breakfast at McDonald's with my mom, my younger brother, camp friends, and their parents. Then, we all went to the camp bus stop at the local high school. While my brother and my camp friends loaded the greyhound buses, buzzing with excitement and nervous energy about spending a month away from home, I stayed back with the parents and waved goodbye as they drove away. Since we were surely going to figure out \"what's wrong\" soon, I planned to go to camp late. I should have known when I started taking out \"just one shirt\" from the royal blue duffel bag on the hallway floor that I would soon be unpacking the entire bag. That summer I watched the fun from the sidelines at home. Through letters from friends, I heard about camp sneak-outs, gross cafeteria food, and which boys the girls liked. Twenty-one years later, now 33 years old, I amjustbeginning to realize the impact living with Crohn's has had on my life, the force it has been in shaping my identity. Watching the fun from the sidelines, as I did on that summer day when the camp buses drove off without me, is a metaphor for how I spent a lot of my time growing up. Beginning at age 12, I needed to take medication three times a day. Staying healthy meant restrictions in my diet. No carbonation, no fake sugar, no drinks from a straw, no chewing gum, no popcorn, no greasy food, no, no, no... Living with Crohn's meant no drinking, which meant when friends began experimenting with alcohol, guess who was always stone cold sober and, as soon as I turned 16, the perpetual designated driver? Me. Then in college, everyone drunk, having fun, enjoying life. Not me. All nighters? I couldn't do it. I stayed up most of the night with my boyfriend who was in town during the fall of freshman year and I ended up in the hospital the next day with a high fever and chills. I was left behind when my parents and brothers vacationed in Mexico when I was in college. They didn't take me because they didn't want me to get sick from the food or water. To be fair, my parents planned to travel alone, but my brothers wheedled their way in on the trip. Even though I asked to join, I was told \"no.\" The thing is, the missed opportunities for fun, the regimented lifestyle, and the premature responsibility, none of that includes the actual medical interventions: The surgeries, hospital visits, blood tests, IVs, colonoscopies, physical exams, medications, allergic reactions to medications, blah, blah, blah... While I have a difficult time remembering my medical experiences in their entirety, I do remember certain pieces vividly. I remember being in the hospital, a male African nurse trying unsuccessfully to put an IV in the top of my skinny little left hand. I was sitting in a chair next to my hospital bed. He was standing over me in his scrubs. I felt helpless, paralyzed with pain and terror. That was probably close to 20 years ago. A million times since then, I've been poked, without flinching. I worked in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; I've seen blood, guts, vomit, and babies who are no longer living. Yet, if I'm in a medical setting and hear the voice of a man with an African accent, I stop dead in my tracks and feel like my heart has momentarily stopped beating. In every medical experience since that fateful IV, I plowed ahead--strong, focused, determined, and without complaint. I pushed my body to the limit, training as if for an athletic event, but really the event was life. If my doctor said six weeks post surgery I could begin more intense physical activity, on the 6-week mark I incorporated jogging into my walks, turned jogging into running, and soon was back where I started or stronger. I'd puke in the trashcan on the side of my high school's track after running just one mile before evening tennis practice. Even though I can run for miles in the morning on an empty stomach, I couldn't run after having eaten breakfast and lunch. My digestive system wouldn't allow it. I coordinated with college professors to have coursework sent to me while I recovered at home from surgery my junior year. I went to the gym to walk on the treadmill during the polar vortex because I needed to get my legs working again. I went to yoga when my hands were numb and did poses on my forearms rather than my palms because I needed to use my body in a positive way. I needed to feel what it was like when my body was working for me, not against me. I needed to be in charge of my body, make it do what I wanted it to. My family fundraised for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) for 15 years and I volunteered for CCFA for over a decade. I created the Pediatric Gastroenterology Family Assistance Fund at University of Chicago Hospital. I'm proud that I didn't allow Crohn's to stop me from achieving, from leading an active, full life. I'm proud of my philanthropic endeavors and the ways my family and I gave back to the GI community. I wouldn't change any of that. I just wish I'd stopped for a minute to be more present inmy ownexperience. By never allowing the space to realize or fully understand that my experience was not typical, I think I did myself a disservice. Several months ago, I started seeing a psychotherapist for the first time in my life, ironic, since I'm a clinical social worker. I sought this support for a personal, important, yet non-Crohn's-related reason. My draw to therapy had to do with me needing to feel alive, to feel passion, excitement, connection, desire, and understanding...to feel whole. I needed to grieve and I was overflowing with anger. I felt panicked and sad about what I had missed and what I felt I was still missing. I wanted to feelreallyalive, like heart-pounding-out-of-my-chest alive. However, when I began to talk, so much of what I shared came back to living life with Crohn's. I couldn't believe that I'd missed how Crohn's influenced not only how I navigate my life, but who I am, and how I act. Here I was, no longer operating in survival mode, no longer dissociating, finally aware of my own body, and my feelings, thoughts, and emotions were pouring out of me like a fire hydrant, burst open, flooding the street. It was as if my Crohn's flare during my recent pregnancy and the traumatic delivery that followed had opened the floodgates of awareness of 20 years of experiences of growing up with Crohn's. I had serious health issues while pregnant with my second baby. Reflecting back, I see that the ailments came on in a fashion akin to that of my initial Crohn's symptoms 20 years prior. The \"we don't know what's wrong with you\" experience was similar as well. The chills, headaches, and fevers during pregnancy paled in comparison to the morning when I woke up with no ability to move any joints of my lower extremities. None. My symptoms were a mystery--a blood clot? MS? Just Crohn's? My world-renowned GI doctor was stumped. \"You're a bit of a black box,\" he said. I sat on the crinkly white paper on the medical exam table and asked, \"So what's the plan?\" My doctor's response was \"We'll figure something out.\" In my mind, that loosely translated into \"We have no freaking clue.\" I was terrified. It was unclear if I'd: A) Need another bowel resection B) Need to try a new medication that \"increases the risk of getting a rare brain infection that usually leads to death\" or C) Wait for the doctors to figure something out. I didn't share it with anyone at the time, but during that pregnancy, I felt I might die, or that I'd potentially live with a severe disability, never able to go running, do yoga, or play at the park with my kids again. With so many drugs pumping through my body and so much illness during pregnancy, I was also secretly scared that my baby wouldn't be healthy. There was nothing to do except hope for a good outcome and wait for delivery. After 15 hours of un-medicated labor, a drastic drop in my blood pressure, and baby's dangerously low heart rate, I was rushed to the operating room for an emergency c-section. I felt the wind blowing against my face as a slew of doctors and nurses raced my bed down the corridor through the automatic doors and into the bright lights. My heart began to pound, my breath became rapid, tears began to flow, and panic set in. I was acutely aware of what was happening, yet, simultaneously feeling in an out-of-body-experience. At the last second, a voice of one of the medical professionals from behind me on my left yelled, \"Heart rate's back up! Cancel the Crash (emergency c-section)! Cancel the Resus (neonatal resuscitation)!\" I had a brief moment of relief, but medical distress continued and a c-section followed just minutes later. While in the recovery room holding my brand new baby, swaddled in the white fleece hospital blanket, wearing a little blue knit hat, I cried. Not happy tears because my baby was healthy. I cried because I failed. My body had failed, again. Until now, I have not shared the intimate details of this all-consuming process of self-reflection and self-discovery that began for me many months ago. I have been scared others wouldn't understand, that they would judge. I had, however, confided in Rebecca, a dear friend of mine. Rebecca is soft-spoken, wicked smart, a talented mental health professional, and knows trauma. She was also my roommate in graduate school, and has taken me to the ER, stayed with me overnight until my parents arrived, calmly rubbing my legs, my body shivering and shaking with chills, my fever dangerously high. During one of our many phone conversations, I was teary, struggling, trying to make sense of my life as if I was working to solve a physics problem, yet didn't have enough information and didn't know the right equations. She responded, \"Al, this is your journey to find your authentic self.\" I laughed. Leave it to Rebecca to name this humbling, painful, and often lonely process something so pretty, so succinct... so... accurate. Rebecca's description resonated with me. I continue along my journey towards healing, wholeness, and authenticity. I am starting to integrate the fragmented parts of myself, the decades of living in a regimented, need-to-stay-healthy way. I'm beginning to acknowledge the medical trauma that my physical body endured as threats to its very being, but to which my conscious awareness was not connected. I am peeling back layers of emotions I never recognized and feelings I never felt. I am having revelations about decisions I made and paths I chose. There is so much. I can't contain it in my body and mind anymore. I need to share it so that I'm not carrying it alone. As I bring to my full awareness this new, yet old, information, I continue to be stunned. And each time I find a new piece of clarity along the way, the most interesting thing happens: my body gets warm, yet feels chilled, my lips feel tingly and chapped, and I feel feverish... just like I do almost every single time a Crohn's flare is beginning.",

    "data": "A Conversation with Julie Norstrand, PhD, MSW, MSc INTRODUCTION Back in January--in what seems like years before the pandemic invaded our lives--Julie Norstrand, an executive board member at the Newton Council on Aging, invited me to join a panel to discuss social isolation among older adults. Already, loneliness and isolation had been declared an epidemic according to AARP (Connect2Affectstudies). Most Americans were beginning to be aware of the isolating forces in the lives of many seniors, especially those who lived alone (one in three people over age 65 live alone according to the US Census Bureau). This panel was to provide a public forum for the citizens of Newton to tackle loneliness and brainstorm on ways to increase the quality of the social lives of older adults. I was keen to join Julie's mission and sit on the panel at the Newton Free Library, scheduled for June 8th. It was heartening to get to know her as we discussed our talking points --but suddenly, in the middle of March, the lockdown began, and all of our planning froze. We decided to pause for a few weeks. But Julie persisted in staying in touch to pull together the other panelists and organizers. We all marveled at the irony of our predicament: Now weourselvesare isolated and painfully aware of how our older loved ones were evenmoreisolated. What could we do to break through the isolating forces of the pandemic, particularly in Newton? Julie's determination led us through our planning and goalsetting, and her passion for the project was inspirational. The panel was held on June 8th, and over sixty citizens of all ages attended. As an eldercare consultant and a gerontology scholar, Julie has been aware for decades that older adults as they age \"become increasingly invisible and isolated.\" With the advent of the pandemic, she felt a call to action to organize a response in the Newton community. Indeed, before the panel at the library, Julie had been spearheading a group of Newton Council on Aging members to raise awareness of social isolation among older adults in the general community. Before the pandemic hit, Julie and her team had been standing at the library with brochures and ready to answer questions about this important topic. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, this community activism had to stop. In an ongoing effort to tackle loneliness, along with her colleagues at Regis College, Julie recently started to develop a survey of older adults in Newton to assess how well organizations and individuals were reaching out to those most isolated. She also runs her own consultancy, Help My Aging Parents, LLC, guiding her clients in how to juggle the havoc of the pandemic with all the other tasks of caregiving. Ultimately, the goal is to help families plan ahead for caregiving! Finally, Julie is also an adjunct professor in the social work program at Regis college where she teaches social work as well as gerontology courses. Teaching gerontology speaks to another of Julie's missions which is to help students realize the enormous value that the aging population brings to our society; ultimately, to have more students enter the gerontological workforce. I was shocked that Julie had the time to do an interview with me for HSC. I was eager to know what she thought about the effects of COVID-19 on the lives of older adults six months since the start of the pandemic (as of August 2020). Most of all, what could she tell us about how communities could take action in meeting the dire needs of seniors moving forward? My Conversation with Julie Val: What alarmed you about COVID and how it was affecting older adults? Julie:It was quite apparent that there was tremendous anxiety and need for social contact among seniors. When the Newton Senior Center offered phone contact to them, we heard, \"Yes please, I want a call back!\" They were hungry for human contact. The need for contact becomes more poignant as you become older and more vulnerable. I was also hearing from my clients, typically in their fifties or sixties, who had aging parents. I run a support group for adult caregivers through Zoom and was listening to their stories of how COVID had touched their lives. It was so painful for them because they felt so powerless about their parents. One daughter was so worried about her mother in an assisted living community because she could not see her in person (due to COVID visitor restrictions). She said her mother told her, \"I don't see the point of living.\" Some of my clients were in a terrible bind. For example, one daughter wanted to bring her mother home to live with her, but her husband was a physician--there was too much risk of her mother being exposed to COVID. This is the reality of so many families who want their parents to be home with them but worry about their safety. I wondered what more could be done to promote quality of life during COVID at nursing homes and assisted living communities. There needs to be more interventions to create remote groups for social media and online communication. But this would entail more training and access to technical skills for older adults. Val: Having worked recently in activities programs with seniors at assisted living communities, I know that during COVID there has frequently been a shortage of staff and unfortunately not enough time to teach seniors how to use social media or Zoom. So very tragic for those who are left out of the technical solutions. Julie:One thing is certain as we move forward since the pandemic: Older adults will need better access to social media--particularly those who live in assisted living communities and nursing homes. There needs to be more effort put into training them for online communication. It should be easier to get access by creating remote groups.Our Aging in Place models are now looking at different social engagement interventions for a post COVID world. On the bright side, baby boomers (adults in their sixties and seventies) tend to be more savvy about using social media and online social networks. Let's hope that in the next few years, as boomers move into these communities, they will be more comfortable and resilient in building community online. But still, for people now in their eighties and nineties, this technical transition has been terribly difficult for them without the support they have needed during COVID. Val: Even as a boomer myself, I don't take to Zooming too well. I get fed up and exhausted with it. I am starving for more \"warm fuzzies\" from in-person human connection. I can only imagine how it feels to be eighty-five and hungry for human touch. Julie:But as I see it, sadly, this pandemic will last a long time, and there are likely to be more pandemics in the future. This pandemic has forced us to change the way we view social engagement--and older adults who live in nursing homes or assisted living communities will need a much better range of social activities online balanced alongside their in-person activities offline--in short, a good balance. Val: Long before COVID, you were doing research on the benefits of social support for older adults. For over a decade, you have studied how important it is to prevent loneliness and isolation as we age. For example, socially isolated adults are more likely to develop Alzheimer's, as well as develop heart disease. What got you started in this research? Julie:About twenty years ago, I was a research assistant with the Philadelphia Corporation for Aging. Back in the early 2000s, we were involved with a team from New York City working on disaster preparedness planning. We knew of the dire consequences of heatwaves, such as in Chicago and Paris, where older adults were the most vulnerable. Specifically, single or widowed white men were more likely to die of heat exhaustion. Quite frankly, they did not know how to ask for help and get support--and it seemed to them that asking for help was a sign of weakness (but okay for their wives to ask for help.) They had previously relied on their wives or sisters to do all the reaching out as they had the social skills for this task. The men perished trying to tough it out all alone, trying to fend for themselves against the heatwave. So, it all came down to this, as I saw it: Our rugged individualism and social stigma about asking for help was not a healthy approach to aging because we become more vulnerable as we age. We need to learn how to tap our communities, ask for help, talk openly about our needs, build social networks. This was my realization that building social capital was essential as we aged, and our communities could play a greater role in this (especially at removing the stigma against asking for help). Val: You are now working on a survey for older adults coping with COVID-19 and aim to use the survey results to initiate a community response. Based on what you learned from the study during the Chicago heatwave--that some seniors are reluctant to reach out for help, or don't know how--then, how are you planning to offer support in the midst of this pandemic? Julie:I am now in talks with my colleagues at Regis College in developing a survey for older adults in Newton. We will be mailing out surveys to adults aged 75 and older in October. Our surveys will entail 20 to 30 questions. We will be asking how they are coping during COVID-19. It is a nuanced assessment that looks at: how adults are coping, the services and outreach that they have been receiving, the extent to which needs are met, and who they have been reaching out to receive and provide help, and how they are spending their time on a daily basis. Furthermore, a subset of these respondents will also receive friendly phone calls from a Regis college student over a four to five month period. It is hoped these friendly calls will provide some emotional support and friendship during these difficult months ahead. Val: That sounds really helpful. It makes so much sense that you are giving seniors a chance to spell out exactlywhois helping them andhowthey are helping. Specifics are vital here. And even the reluctant folks (proud, \"rugged individualists\") have the opportunity to identify what they need without coming off as too \"needy.\" I also love the idea of the Regis students, mostly young Gen Zs, chatting with the eighty-year-olds. Julie:Yes, and some of those students are feeling scared, left out, and lonely themselves. The older adults can share their life's experiences to comfort and encourage the students--and that makes them feel relevant. Val: Right, feelingrelevant.Researchers studying loneliness have often reported on the importance of having meaningful conversations to alleviate loneliness. But--now that you say the word \"relevant\"--I can see how older adults yearn to be relevant to others, and this is what gives them meaning. Julie:Yes, that's right.The most resilient older adults I studied were the ones who still felt relevant to others. Not only do older adults want to be needed, they want tofeelrelevantto others. When studying social capital with older adults as part of my dissertation, what mattered was the quality of the relationships they had, not just the number of contacts. The key to their emotional and physical health was the quality of their connections. So, in considering how to increase social engagement for older adults, we need to ask the question: How can we help to make them feel more relevant? Val: I imagine you ask your clients that very same question: How can they make their parents feel more relevant? Can you tell me more about your consultancy,Help My Aging Parents? Julie:Yes, I do ask that question a lot. But, more fundamentally, I help my clients plan ahead and think out loud. To have serious conversations about the future of their loved one. I provide eldercare consultation to individuals and families who are increasingly concerned about the well-being of an aging relative, but do not know how to \"step in.\" After a thorough consultation, an effective action plan is developed, tailored to the aging relative's needs and wishes. It all comes down to thinking ahead. Being proactive, not reactive. It's better to plan ahead and consider options when you arenotin the middle of a medical crisis. There is no reason to be caught with financial hurt and emotional hurt in a messy situation that could have been avoided with good planning. Ultimately, you know your parent will need assistance at some point, and the whole experience is just so much more positive if you are ready. And best of all, sometimes, having an honest conversation about caregiving can actually bring the parent emotionally closer with their adult children. I encourage my clients to speak from their hearts about what is on their minds. Val: Hopefully, that honesty can open doors--if it's expressed with genuine love. It's really sad that in our society we tend to put off having those deeper heart-to-hearts, especially about what we need and desire as we become more vulnerable in our aging process. Julie, the work you do is so vital. You empower family members to \"go there\" to the hard topics and scenarios that we often dread talking about. And your research and insights are valuable. I am so pleased we could talk today. Thank you very much. And, oh yes, please keep me posted on how the survey is going. Julie:I certainly will. This was a lovely chat, and I appreciate your time.

    "data": "Segment 9 in our seriesSoul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill by Shaler McClure Wright Introduction You're listening to episode nine ofSoul Chronicles,offering a soulful perspective on how to navigate the unique challenges of living with ongoing health conditions. Special thanks to Health Story Collaborative for hosting this monthly audio column. My name is Shaler McClure Wright and I'm a writer/creative living with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. Story - Tossed in the Hopper of Cultural Pain When I think of a soulful approach to life I think of seeking beauty. Calling attention to beautiful moments as they unfold, or reflecting on those that may have passed without notice. But right now I'm immersed in its opposite; something shadowy and so ominous it can't be ignored. So here is my warning--if you're looking for butterflies, glitter and light, you won't find them here today. Because before I can make my way back to the restorative path of all-things-good in the world, I need to acknowledge the looming presence of current events that threatens to eclipse the natural light of beauty and soul. We're in the grips of a pervasive cultural pain to which no one is immune. It's uncomfortable, unsettling and it's spreading. When we try to discuss it publicly, we strain for civility, and find ourselves having to avoid words that might be considered inflammatory, and sometimes that leaves us without words at all. So we're stuck in a cycle of speak/regret/retreat, and each round of failed conversation creates more pain. I've chosen a name for this condition. Sanitation Syndrome. I call it Sanitation Syndrome because ironically, the more we try to sanitize it, the more we enable it to grow. By sanitize I mean making light of divisive comments or avoiding conversation about it altogether. And if left unchecked, Sanitation Syndrome will gather strength, brewing in the background, until all of a sudden we find ourselves steeped in a national infection. How do we learn to recognize it? Sanitation Syndrome occurs when words are weaponized to divide us, and once divided, we can no longer speak the same language. The best word to describe Sanitation Syndrome is toxic, and our well-intentioned attempts to contain it actually end up making things worse, by compressing it into something smaller, more dense and more toxic. Sanitation Syndrome is spreading through every corner of our country by seeping into our bodies with just enough heat to smolder, like a fire that burns from the inside out. In order to reflect on this national illness (though I'd still prefer to reflect on beauty), I'll choose an image to represent the aspects of Sanitation Syndrome that are hardest to visualize. Not surprisingly, I'm choosing a piece of sanitation equipment--a garbage truck--to represent the vehicle for both its containment and growth. Imagine one big national garbage truck making rounds on a sweltering summer day with the purpose of containing all things exposed to Sanitation Syndrome--including people. It's like we're all being unceremoniously tossed in its hopper, with its giant compactor pressing us ever closer together, until finally we're squished into one big brick of unrecognizable waste. And once we've been reduced to garbage, we begin to simmer with a smell most aptly associated with toxic stew. We think our lives will be less messy if we compact the trash. But as it turns out, compacted trash takes up less space, but it's no less nasty. It's simply more concentrated. I admit, I've tried to insulate myself from the reaching arms of our national garbage truck, but in doing so my world has grown smaller and smaller. And that's not good. Truth is, Sanitation Syndrome is fueled by the pain of despair, and no amount of padding is thick enough to insulate us from its friction or burn. It's not that I don't care about the issues we face--I care deeply--but like many of you, I need to balance awareness with health. And right now, to be honest, I'm failing. When I clench with instinctive resistance, my desire for self protection feels like a vice tightening around my body. So insulation isn't an option. We need to face this sickness head-on, or we might find ourselves wrapped in a vice and crushed in a hopper all at once. When our lives have been compacted into one big brick of toxic waste it leaves us gobsmacked--shocked--and unable to think clearly. It's hard to take action. Like Bill Murray's conundrum in \"Groundhog Day,\" waking up again and again to the same problems, we find ourselves stuck in the throes of recurring gobsmack attacks. So how might we gain perspective about this predicament? By educating ourselves as much as we can. Think of it this way, learning about Sanitation Syndrome is not so different from hearing a diagnosis we don't want to hear, or conducting research on a medical condition we'd rather not have--so perhaps we're better prepared to do this work than we realize. There's something potent about the collective endurance of cultural pain, and the possibility leaves me wondering, \"If enough of us can endure it, can we also clear it? Can we banish Sanitation Syndrome from our lives?\" I've spoken before about the transformative potential of personal experience and I'd like to share an example. Just yesterday I had an experience of uncontrollable trembling, for no apparent reason other than hearing the news stream in the background while I was cooking. Like the fire of Sanitation Syndrome--burning from the inside out--my trembling began as an invisible inner tremor. But eventually it got so bad I couldn't hold a knife steady enough to chop vegetables. Soulfully speaking, trembling can indicate a profound experience, transformation on a cellular level. Our body signals us with a combination of tears, rage, trembling, or dizziness. We might feel disoriented, but it's actually a process of reorientation, and in the case of Sanitation Syndrome, a rejection. I believe a collective shake-out may be the best way to begin the process of collective healing. In his book \"Healing Trauma\", Dr Peter Levine suggests, \"People do, in fact, possess the same built-in ability to shake off threats that animals do. I have found that, if given appropriate guidance, human beings can and do shake off the effects of overwhelming events and return to their lives.\" So if the first step is a shake-out, then the second step would be a reconstitution. How do we begin to transform our toxic stew into something more palatable? Transformation is a complex and exhausting process, some of which is within our control, but much of it is a mystery, perhaps even requiring a leap of faith. And like our slimy, compacted waste, it can be messy. As an example, let's look at the metamorphosis of a butterfly. In the Scientific American article \"How Do Caterpillars Turn Into Butterflies?\"we learn that \"first, the caterpillar digests itself, releasing enzymes to dissolve all of its tissues. If you were to cut open a chrysalis, you'd find a soupy meltdown of the caterpillar's body.\" Caterpillar soup contains highly specialized imaginal discs that undergo rapid cell division, differentiation and growth. Eventually these disks become imaginal cells that make up the physiology of a butterfly. The mystery of a butterfly's transformation is rooted in these imaginal cells. (And of course I see a connection between the words imagination and imaginal.) Evolution biologist Dr. Elisabet Sahtouris refers to the connection between the current state of our country and the birth of a butterfly in her book \"EarthDance\": \"If we see ourselves as imaginal discs working to build the butterfly of a better world, we will understand that we are launching a new 'genome' of values and practices, to replace that of the current unsustainable system. We will also see how important it is to link with each other in the effort, to recognize how many different kinds of imaginal cells it will take to build a butterfly with all its capabilities and colors.\" So what do you think? Can we weather our Sanitation Syndrome garbage truck ride with the transformative grace of a butterfly? I warned you there would be no butterflies in this chronicle, and there aren't. Yet. But we can visualize the possibility. And so I leave you with this vision of emerging beauty-- Imagine how precious it would be to gather for a conversation that's free of disinformation, flowing with words as beautiful as the first unfolding of a butterfly's wings.

    "data": "When a heavy object falls on one's foot, it exerts pressure on the skin and muscles, and that hurts. Raw sensation is the pressure, and everything beyond that is interpretation. To feel is a combination of raw sensation and interpretation from the brain based on past experiences. But when one loses the ability to recall, one loses the ability to interpret and sometimes even the ability to feel. My grandmother's gradual decline all started over a decade ago, in the Malagasy province of Morondava, in Madagascar. My father remembers the day when everything radically pivoted and his world turned upside down: after a strenuous day of housework, my grandmother --for just a moment -- confused day and night. A few years later, the diagnosis was given: Alzheimer's disease, coupled with brain aging and a strong 25-year-old depression. My grandmother moved to the capital city of Madagascar to become the sixth resident of our household. My parents, sisters and I shaped our lives and schedules according to what we thought my grandmother would feel most comfortable with. She was the beloved center of our lives. Within several years, all my grandmother could remember clearly was her name. It seemed as if she had entered a parallel universe she had created herself. She got lost in her thoughts while tracing flower patterns with her feet and counting the number of lights out loud. There was no way of telling what she was thinking. I could not bare thinking about how often she felt lost, alone, or misunderstood. The thought haunted me for days; it made me feel utterly helpless. As her amnesia worsened and her brain activity declined, my grandmother stopped interpreting raw sensation, and, slowly lost her reflexes. She sometimes forgot to drink water after putting a pill in her mouth, and chewed on the medicine instead. The bitter taste surely made its way through the taste buds on the back of her tongue, and was probably sent to her central nervous system, but somehow was not interpreted. Not a single cringe showed on her face. One may say that her inability to interpret sensation caused her to stop feeling. Indeed, not once did my grandmother show signs of anger, sadness, or even slight feelings of impatience. But she often laughed. Each time she disappeared into her parallel world, I witnessed genuine happiness. Some people believe that acts of kindness and empathy do not make a difference in a world in which man has already reached the moon. But I believe that it is the little steps we make that end up being the most precious ones. Offering to share her popcorn while watching cartoons on TV made my grandmother happy. When I simply asked about her day, or commented on the flowers that grew in the garden, a smile appeared on her face. As I grew older, I understood the importance of empathizing with my grandmother. And how could I possibly attempt to do so without her collaboration? I could not change the way she perceived her world, but I could change the way I perceived her world: it all had to do with acceptance. Empathy, I feel, is the ultimate solution to alleviate one's pain and help someone make peace with their condition. Within empathy lies acceptance. Coming to terms with a condition is the first step towards wellness. My grandmother was not part of the world I knew so well -- this was a fact I could not argue against. There was no use in me trying to include her in the present by constantly reminding her of the time of day or the year, trying to bring her back into my reality only confused her. In the last years before my grandmother passed away, my family and I ceased trying to heal her by forcing her to remember. We let her imagination go free, and even took part in her adventures. Her imagination, stimulated by compassion and attention, helped her recall certain pleasures of places, smells, sights, tastes, and faces from her past. This seemed to allow her to reconnect with small part of her old self, and make her feel more comfortable in her daily life. I am eternally grateful for all I learned from my grandmother. Her story taught me the immense powers of compassion. Heena Nissaraly is a sophomore at Boston College majoring in Nursing and minoring in Medical Humanities. She aims to become an empathic nurse specialized in anesthesia or hospice care, and hopes to eventually improve healthcare in Madagascar.",

    "data": "By Chuck Fox, MD I am on day 14 of self-imposed isolation from the Coronavirus given my underlying moderately severe lung disease. You may remember from a prior post that I'm a physician, but I have not been to the office since March 12th. It's the longest I've ever not gone to work in my 14+ year career at my practice.My four (all non-CF, of course) partners have been covering for me in the office and the hospital -- they were so gracious about making sure that I protected myself given my pre-existing condition.I am doing all that I can from my house including taking all phone calls from the hospital doctors consulting our service, joining conference calls about the hospital and practice response to the pandemic, and setting up a telemedicine program for our patients to continue to receive medical care.Yet, I have tremendous guilt about the fact that my partners are essentially risking their lives to cover for me and ensure that I reduce my risk of contracting COVD-19, and also extreme anxiety regarding the possibility of one of my partners getting sick or even dying from the virus. As most of us know by now, the virus does not discriminate based on age, and there have been plenty of reports of young (under age 50) people getting pneumonia and dying from the disease.I have reached out to my partners, had multiple group chats with them, have sent them each a hand-written thank you note, and my wife and I sent each of their families a gift basket on-line with all kinds of snacks and other goodies.I am maintaining my \"productivity,\" essentially doing FaceTime Telehealth visits for approximately 6-7 patients per day over the past week from the comfort of my own home. The patients have been so appreciative, patient, and kind. The vast majority of them are doing quite well thus far, maintaining social distancing, and following the guidelines regarding protecting oneself from the microorganism.Personally, I have a weird feeling of being like an outsider in this whole situation, because I am not going to the hospital or office to meet and examine patients. Rationally, of course I realize that I have no choice, that -- if I were to contract COVID, I would almost certainly get pneumonia, possibly wind up on a ventilator and taking up an ICU bed -- and even if I were to survive it, would put myself at risk for worsening lung function long-term and increasing the rapidity with which I might someday need a lung transplant. That, if anything, I have a duty to my family and my community to stay healthy and not make this situation worse.However, because I am not \"out there\" in the medical community actively taking care of patients, when I see or hear all these tributes on-line or on the news acknowledging and praising the doctors on the front lines, I do experience a bit of sadness inside. I am different because of my CF, and this is one of those situations that really shines the light on that.I have risked my life to care for patients over the years. As a third year medical student, in 1997, I got HIV+ blood in my eye in the Mass General emergency room. I have rounded in the hospital and seen in the office innumerable patients with respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, the flu, tuberculosis, etc., to which I could have easily been exposed and contracted. Yet, in this situation, because of the extreme transmissibility of this disease and its predilection to cause pneumonia, I am relegated to the sidelines. I would be lying if I said it doesn't hurt to sit this one out.But I must power on. One of my best friends once gave me some amazing advice that I try and remember almost daily: \"Don't focus on what you're NOT doing, focus on what you ARE doing.\" So I'm going to do that. I am going to do everything I can virtually for my patients, my partners, and my practice. I am going to help out my local community, place of worship, and CF Foundation Chapter. And I'm going to keep in mind that there are many millions of others around the world -- sick, food or shelter insecure, and/or unemployed -- that are much worse off than my family and I are right now. I will spend the next few (weeks? months?) appreciative of what I have, keeping a positive attitude, and helping those in need.Fellow CF'ers and family members and friends -- stay safe, make smart choices, and be healthy.

    "data": "By Gillian I was never a great swimmer. My body would tire and my muscles would ache. I'd thrash and squirm and gulp saltiness. I'll never forget the feeling of inhaling water, the burning that sweeps through the lungs and the stinging during the slow recovery. It was like that. TheAfter. An inescapable breathlessness. A heaving and gasping and gulping, grasping for anything to hold onto. The in and out that skip and hasten. The airways close and the throat is no longer a tunnel but a labyrinth, constricting tighter and tighter. There's choking for air, but the ocean is inside of you, swarming, swaying, swelling, spilling over the top. And the cannon fire to underscore it all. A stampede of thuds clamoring in the chest, a great crescendo echoing up to the ears, drumming to a spiraling tempo...thud,thud,thud-thud,thudthudthudthud. Like a fist pounding on a door, banging, clanging, threatening to rip it open. A ringing thunder to drown it all out... I try not to think too much about TheBefore. The mythical time when you're blissfully unaware of the ticking time bomb waiting to explode, waiting to punch the irreparable hole in your chest. The time when you took everything for granted, overlooked the one person who'd love you unconditionally. Before you'd ever known true loss, before every single ounce of pain paled in comparison to the insurmountable agony you'd feel. The time before the world shut down and you found yourself standing in a hospital room wrapped in layers of plastic, reaching out to a pale arm that was far too cold and unrecognizable... I'm lost in TheAfter. There's disbelief. Denial, backtracking, shock. Each new question is an unsolvable riddle. How? How could this happen? It wasn't supposed to be like this. We had plans. We had tickets to that show. She was supposed to come visit me that semester. We were going to do so much when this was all over. We were supposed to be together forever. I meant to say something before... Did I get to it? Everything was fine a week ago. And we were just talking about--what's going to happen from now on? I didn't get any sleep last night because of my darkly wandering mind, so maybe I willed it into existence. Did she know how late I stayed up, or could she hear the TV from the living room I kept on all night? There's remembering. Some things are crystal clear, like steppingstones through time, while others are fogged over, like warm breath clouding a looking glass. Those flashes of memory that come with or without invitation, possessing the mind to another time, another place, another reality. Sometimes you remember things like they were yesterday, that dumb joke that made you belly laugh, those long drives down backroads just to get out of the house, the warmth that filled the apartment when the oven was on. And other times, you don't know if you just imagined them. You're stuck in this purgatory of re-memory. There's reminding. Those cruel tricks of the mind. Like phantom pain in lost limbs every time you try to walk on one foot. Like tracing the hole of a missing tooth with your tongue and being surprised each time. The constant forgetting and reminding and shock cycles in an endless loop. Reminding yourself what was lost. Turning your head to speak to a ghost. Fighting the urge to think of their name, tell them your daily grievances like you'd always do. Reliving the gut-wrenching bombshell every single time until you don't really remember what's missing, just the colossal, gaping hole left behind. There's regretting. The \"what ifs\" and \"should haves\" bounce around your mind until they pound like angry fists against your skull. It comes back in little spurts and pours down in shameful raindrops that soak your brain. Your worst moments play back in a beautifully miserable compilation, and you're struck withs the excruciating fact that you knew better but didn't do anything. There's fuming. You curse the world and everyone in it. Toss around blame like it's a kickball on a playground. Ride the spinning carnival wheel of anger and guilt and shame. Screw those who have what I don't and all the people it should've been. Screw this stupid country and all the people whose fault this is. I hate everyone and everything and all the things I used to love--I hate them, or they're gone, too. There's reeling. There is noBefore. There's justthis. Only trudging through murky waters and the fogginess of those nighttime hallucinations that seem all too real. Every now and then there's a rumbling in the stomach, but it numbs if you wait long enough. I imagined my body to be a cavernous gorge, the wind rumbling through the rocky cliffs, clashing into grumbling rocks with heated breaths. I wondered if I'd sink down into the bed, if the blankets would consume me, smother the wind within me, bury me under if I waited long enough. There's lying. And hiding. You lie to yourself and everyone you know. Lie to strangers on the Internet that it'll get better. Paint those pretty smiles on plastic cheeks and get good marks because that's all they really care about. Go through the motions, you've done this before. Make a good show, you've always loved theatrics. Tell them a lovely little story and brush it all off. Oh, what a great actress you are! There's un-remembering. Memory is the curse of the living. You shut out everything that happened and everything that's happening. Shut out who you were and who you are. Blank out all the faces that haunt your memories and drown out all the voices you once knew until they're just background noise. Let yourself sink into that dark void because it's more bearable than anything that came before. There's failing. I sit in her seat but I can't fill her shoes, every step I take, I'm bound to lose. I can't help these people with the heavy eyes who just want something to do. All their kindness towards me is because of her. I was never the socialite, I'm horrible company, too. I can't light up a room, that was always her. So don't dare ask me to make that dish for Thanksgiving because I don't know the recipe, she's the one who always made it and I'm not her replacement. There's forgetting. The ironic panic that fills your chest as you forage through your mind for lost treasures. Where did that pink cat knickknack that sat on the television mantle come from? It was from a vacation she went on, but was it Puerto Rico or Mexico? And what was in that stroganoff recipe, I know it had cream of mushroom soup, but did she include broth? She never measured anything, and I never wrote it down, and I tried to make it but it just wasn't the same. And did we ever watch that movie together, what did she think? What did she say? What was the name of that friend she mentioned? There's no one to ask... There's seeing. That newfound vision you can't shake. Grief is like a pair of glasses you can't take off; you see the world differently, even though nothing's changed. The earth turns and seasons change but you're stuck seeing everything for all its ugliness. Seeing all the ghosts that lurk in the darkness. And the newfound blindness that accompanies it. That darkness that invades your mind when you think of the fabled future. I used to have that picture--the one people have when they close their eyes and cast themselves into a far-off land and see themselves older, hopeful, wiser. When they imagine what's to come and pour their hearts into making that beautiful dream a reality. I don't have that anymore. I'm losing grip on it. I can't see myself. Or her. It's all gone. There's accepting. The surrender as you swallow this new reality. It'll always be like this. I'll always be likethis. There's no going back and noBefore. Justthis. I'm not the same person I used to be. I don't really remember them anymore. They're a stranger. A distant memory, like an illusory figure in a far-off dreamland. I'm resolved tothis. To pain. To emptiness. To numbness. To nothingness. To moving on. To forgetting and starting over. I'm tethered to the sickly motion of time as it hurls me forward, stumbling into some great unknown. I don't want the same things I used to. My dreams are smaller now and I think I can be okay with that. I have to be. Sometime in the inescapableNow. There's realizing. Those sorrowful faces you can't help because you don't even know where to start. But it's okay because they look at you with that same sadness. Those voices that tell their stories and make you brave enough to tell yours. Those eyes that look at you not with pity, but with understanding. That recognition of mirrored loss and struggle and grief. And maybe you're not the only one with newfound vision. There are those people that hear you and see you and sometimes that's enough.

    "data": "By Carolyn Payne Solace is found on a peak at sunrise. The silence, the pristine air, and the beams of light reflecting off fresh snow melt away my anxiety. My body moves into rhythmic carving, and I feel my skis float more with each breath. Memories flow through me: my first kiss, my best and longest friendships, and my greatest sense of resilience after recovering from injury. People often ask how I have time as a doctor-in-training to be outside. For me, the outdoors has always provided refuge and renewal. Today was no different. After a week of devastating news stories and overwhelming changes, skiing gave me a few hours where it was as if the coronavirus didn't exist. Health is not merely the absence of disease, according to the World Health Organization. I've been thinking about this a lot while self-isolating in Vermont. I'm alone in a small space, far away from loved ones. My neighbors blast their TVs and drink alcohol all day. The small town has limited health resources. Yet, the state is rapidly filling with affluent city dwellersretreatingto their vacation homes, and I get it. I've lived in dense cities. Dogs poop on sidewalks and sniff trash in the bushes. Roads are filled with angry drivers. Despite all the people, city residents seem to feel just as isolated and disconnected as those who live in rural areas. I am concerned that American cities have limited access to the outdoors, and we are significantlymigratingto them. This matters. We evolved to live outside together, but people across the nation are spending unprecedented amounts of timesitting insidealone. It is no coincidence that we are increasingly unhealthy. Americans aremore obesethan ever before. Close to half have at least one chronic disease. Suicide, opioid fatalities, and other \"deaths of despair\" are rising. Despite our country's wealth and medical advances, American life expectancy isdropping. As the pandemic changes the world as we know it, it is time for Americans to reconnect with the outdoors. Watching loved ones get sick or die and having daily life transformed by emergency orders is traumatic. I, along with many Vermonters, are finding relief in the outdoors. Other Americans should too. Research shows that theoutdoors improves health. Being in green spaces for as little as10 minutesis associated with better mental health, including higher happiness scores. Spending time in the outdoors is alsocorrelatedwith lower cortisol, stroke incidence, and mortality. Evenimaginingbeing outside can improve your health now and after the pandemic, but nothing is better than real outdoor activity. Most of us are physically able and legally allowed to be outside. You can go alone or with your quarantine buddy, just stay in local areas andsix feetfrom others. You can literally put your cell phone down right now and go for a walk or even a ski if you're lucky enough to live somewhere that still has snow. Don't tell me you don't have time! If you commit to moving outside, you will feel less overwhelmed, down, or isolated. Your mind will be present, blood pressure will drop, and calories will burn. Consider the stories ofPhillip Stinis and Karla Amador. Phillip lost 80 pounds and healed his chronic back pain by becoming a mountaineer (without the gym). After a devastating emotional time, Karla said, \"I went for a hike, and for the first time in a year and a half, I felt hope.\" They shared their goal of hiking once a week for a year, which started a movement called52 Hike Challenge. People everywhere have been putting their cell phones, stresses, and insecurities aside to climb mountains and reconnect with what it means to be human. You can join them. Being outside will impact your identity and make you part of a community that transcends classes and borders. Amy Roberts, executive director of the Outdoor Industry Association,says, \"When I talk with somebody about the outdoors...They all say, 'I'm a skier; I'm a climber; I'm a runner.'\" The outdoors creates purpose and much-needed community, motivating the pursuit of physical, mental, and social health everywhere. If we connect with the outdoors during this pandemic, great things will happen. We will appreciate the importance of being healthy. We will be reminded that, as just one small part of the universe, we cannot control everything. Most importantly, we will be grateful for life and each other, motivating us to support and love people in our community, country, and world. We can finally act together to move away from our sedentary, materialistic \"hustle culture\" and even take on bigger challenges like healing our environment and limitingclimate change. As we go through one of the most devastating health crises in history, the outdoors can help. Sit by a flower, take a walk, or go for a ski. It will do wonders. Others will do the same, and America will come out of the next few months healthier and stronger because of it. Carolyn Payne is an avid skier, hiker, and climber. She recently graduated as a Master of Public Health from Harvard University and an MD from University of Vermont. Carolyn will begin family medicine residency in June.

    "data": "Anne grew up with privilege. She was well-educated, and she had resources. She married a Harvard professor. She sent her children to a prestigious private school. On the surface, her life looked neat and pretty, even enviable. But her life had another, hidden side. For over forty years, Anne has struggled with drug and alcohol addiction, and for many of these years, while injecting amphetamines and heroin, her life was controlled by the need to find her next fix. I knew Anne while growing up in the 1970's and 80's. She was my friend's mom. I remember her as warm and open, striking in her mini-skirts and stylish boots. While she was certainly more Bohemian than my own mother, I had no clue that she was an addict. I never would have guessed at the suffering that was going on in my friend's home. Addiction is a disease with enormous financial and human costs: the National Institute of Drug Addiction estimates thatsubstance abuse in the United Statescosts more than $600 billion annually. Addiction has been linked to increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, stroke, certain cancers, and mental illness. Intravenous drug use accounts for more than one-third of the new cases of HIV, and for the majority of cases of Hepatitis C, which can lead to liver cirrhosis, and in rare cases, liver cancer. Medical research has only recently started to characterize addiction asa disease of the brainthat preys on and alters the limbic system, the brain's reward center. This has changed various approaches to treatment, and should also temper our judgment of the individuals who suffer from this condition. Here, Anne, now 67, speaks about her long struggle with addiction. With tremendous courage, she talks about her pain, the pain she caused others, her numerous attempts to get sober and her many relapses. Anne has been sober for seven years now, a huge accomplishment. But her struggle continues because addiction is a chronic, lifelong disease.

    "data": "Emily's eating disorder developed when she was just 14, shortly after she left home to attend boarding school, when her parents were getting divorced. She talks about the difficulty she had - and sometimes still has - in speaking and claiming the word \"bulimia\". She reflects on how her eating disorder was not born from body hatred, but rather a plethora of painful emotions seething inside her. For years, Emily's eating disorder was her hidden identity, active to varying degrees but always present. She was convinced it would always be a part of her life. But finally, when she was 28, her family confronted her and revealed that they knew about it. Emily allowed them to serve as her initial motivation to begin recovery. When she first entered treatment, Emily struggled to even find the words to articulate her feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. But as she began to crumble in the safety of treatment, she also began to blossom. Now 32, Emily resides in San Diego, California where she devotes herself to mothering her 20-month-old daughter, Winnie. She shares her aspirations for Winnie, and the values born from her experiences in recovery that steer her parenting decisions. And she speaks about how being a mom has bolstered her along the path of recovery, and celebrates how far she has come.",

    "data": "High in the branches of a maple tree, with my feet planted firmly on a large branch, I stand with my arms hugging a higher limb, looking out over the field of grass browning in the cool autumn air. The colorful red, brown, and gold leaves dance around me as the wind gently blows, bringing smells of dry decay to my nostrils as I draw a breath deep within my chest to catch every note dancing on the wind. The bark scratching the skin on my hands and arms feels drier and coarser than the summertime bark. The combination of wrestling leaves, breeze howling, and the call of crows is interrupted by my name being called, \"John, what is the answer to question number three?\" My focus adjusts and a classroom comes into view once again. Desks in neat rows like cars in a traffic jam on the highway, flat walls at right angles adorned with posters highlighting sentence structure, defining prepositions, and literary quotes from supposedly great men. The air hits my nostrils again, now impregnated with that stale smell that has always made me tired, while 20+ other 17-year-olds stare at me along with a clearly frustrated Miss Der-Dolder, my high school English teacher. I must have been in the tree for several minutes because I am multiple pages behind and have no idea what the answer to number three is, not to mention the question. As a wave of shame floods my system with the adrenaline of a cornered animal prodded by its captor, I quickly flip pages to where I see questions numbered and develop my witty response. The teacher scoffs and answers the question for me. Thankful that the pressure is off I look down at my open book and pretend to write, filled with both guilt and relief. You see, high school English was the least interesting subject of many very uninteresting subjects in the mind of this very depressed 17-year-old male struggling with undiagnosed ADHD, who was failing school due to lack of attendance and the inability to pay attention in class. I had been a passionate and innately curious kid. I taught myself martial arts from watching TV and practiced for hours on end. I took up archery, setting up targets in the wild Idaho land surrounding my house, and became a skilled bowman. In seventh grade, I mastered Dungeons and Dragons, studying the rule book like a research scientist. I was hungry for knowledge, but school deflated that desire. One of the greatest tragedies of this time in my life is that I was actually very bright and knew that something was wrong, but my attempts to explain the void I felt to school counselors and teachers only resulted in them piling on more study halls and mandatory after school catch up work. I felt trapped and misunderstood. I was soon suspended due to lack of attendance--an ironic punishment-- and though I attempted to finish 12th grade through night school and summer school, the lack of support at home and in school led me to give up, completely overwhelmed and ashamed. In my childhood, we normally moved two to three times a year, which meant I normally attended up to three schools a year. It was normal for my sister and me to spend hours at night hanging out in the parking lot of the Cub tavern, forbidden to leave the car until my mother finally emerged. It was normal to have a whole new cast of characters being entertained in my home at 2:30 in the morning when the bars closed, and to be threatened with violence when we asked to have the music turned down so that we could sleep because we had school in the morning. I normally witnessed violence--physical, verbal, mental and emotional. I normally felt afraid to even say sorry for fear of being hurt. My parents pulled their first all-nighter, leaving my sister and me home alone, when I was 8 years old. Later, it became normal for my mother to disappear for days or sometimes weeks. My normal was chaos. By age 17, with all plans to finish high school abandoned, I sunk deeper into depression. The idea of working a job to survive drained the life out of me. Kitchen work and construction seemed the only entry-level jobs I could find, and both of those environments felt hostile and unappreciative, with an \"I own you\" mentality. I had moved out of my family's home just prior to being kicked out of school and moved in with a friend who was living in a destitute shack on his grandfather's property. The Shack was built in the 1930s and was cobbled together for a 5-ft blind woman out of an old pull trailer with a classic Mickey Mouse drop pin hitch. There was no foundation and the house had settled in a couple of places and rotted in even more. There was no floor left under the bathroom sink and a frog would often shower with me as I cleaned myself in a squatting position because it was so short. After a year, I finally gave in to the idea of drinking and smoking marijuana. At first, it was uncomfortable, and I felt out of sorts and even more disconnected from myself, but I remember the night everything clicked into place, and I felt powerful, acknowledged, and seen. Five people stand in the kitchen with a single burner of the stove on high and two knives resting in the coils of the burner glowing red hot. My roommate and I had cleaned our paraphernalia-- mainly a single utensil we called the pounder, and 64 knife hits of resin lay before us. I have the steadiest hands and the most confidence, so I am designated as what we lovingly refer to as the blade master--or Master Hall--the one who administers the hit to each person, even though I am also absolutely intoxicated. As each person steps up and inhales the smoke from the carefully prepared hits, we bear-hug each other with lungs full of smoke to increase the effect. We laugh so hard. The camaraderie and acceptance, together with the mind-numbing effects of the drugs, allow me respite from my suffering. Who would have thought that a childhood steeped in an environment of heavy substance use and chaos and no healthy skills would make me a perfect candidate for using mind-altering drugs as a coping mechanism? I found my peers through the party network. They had lived through similar experiences and knew what it felt like to fall through the cracks of society. They accepted me and acknowledged me. I felt valued and grew to value them as my people, my friends, and my family. But I still felt uneasy and miserable inside, and I looked for ways to escape beyond recreational drug use. Always a seeker, I studied physical disciplines, mental disciplines, spiritual philosophies diving deep into meditation and mindfulness, which gave me a great deal of clarity. I had a few stints of sobriety lasting years, but when bigger life challenges hit-- mostly consisting of romantic relationship difficulties--I quickly returned to substance use for relief. Alcohol became my drug of choice. At age 45, I got four DUIs in a short period of time and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. This is when I finally surrendered. I was just so tired of feeling ambivalent, untethered, and alone. I knew I needed to ask for help and within days of receiving my fourth DUI, I entered an outpatient rehab and made a commitment to get out of my own way. It was then, during a therapy session, that I had a healing vision: I see my adult self walk into a dark room with no windows in an old Victorian house. I recognize a child sitting on the floor in front of me, curled up in a ball, knees held close to his chest. It is five-year-old me, scared and alone. As my adult self, I step to him, pick him up, and tell him that I love him. I reach into my coat pocket and pull out a key. \"This is the key that unlocks all the obstacles of the past,\" I tell young John. \"We will unlock them together.\" When I entered prison, I decided that this institution would be my Monastery and my University. Within the walls of my new high-security Retreat Center, I sought out any and all systems, books, and individuals who could give me answers to a lifetime of suffering and that is exactly what I found. I met with mental health counselors and was finally diagnosed with ADHD, PTSD, and generalized anxiety disorder. I began to read and participate in groups with a true student mind while addressing my alcoholism through the AA community. Hearing the experiences of other people struggling with mental health and substance use disorder gave me a sense of belonging and hope. I worked the 12 steps with a sponsor and found great clarity and accountability in my story. This, in combination with reading and participating in groups about anxiety management, shame and self-esteem, codependency and healthy relationships, PTSD, and grief and loss gave me the coping skills that I had longed for my whole life. Today I am more than five and a half years sober and work as a mental health group facilitator, a sponsor in the AA community, and as a peer support specialist. I have found purpose and passion in helping others understand and manage their mental health and substance use disorder. I have also changed my relationship with the past and the cards I was dealt in life. Where I once was a victim, I am now the hero of my story. Those pains that I suffered are experiences I get to share with others so that they can believe in the possibility of change. I can say with all sincerity that I would not trade my experiences for anyone else's. They have made me who I am today. The curiosity, passion, and adventurous spirit of my boyhood have been re-awakened. Today, I focus my energies on being the best that I can be, and on helping others who are struggling. Although I still have hard days, I am stronger than I have ever been. I love myself. I trust myself. I am a receptive student of life. About the Author Born into the family disease of alcoholism, John Hall has been faced with generational disfunction and a lack of healthy coping skills. John struggled as a teen and young adult with depression and anxiety. His lack of knowledge about mental health led to it being untreated until his mid-40s, when John was sentenced to prison for DUIs, as he himself was self-medicating with alcohol. He used the two-and-a-half years he was incarcerated to study and better understand his own mental health and substance use disorder. Now, John helps others who are going through the journey as a peer support specialist, Nami group facilitator, prison mentor and public speaker. He believes that every moment is an opportunity to improve our lives and help one another.",

    "data": "By Val Walker My new blog spotlights the thought leaders and organizations working to reclaim conversation and storytelling. I profile authors, speakers, podcast hosts, educators, and researchers dedicated to the power of communication through the spoken word. I also take a hard look at how social media and other technologies are threatening our ability just to have a decent conversation--from a casual chat to a serious heart-to-heart. Studies show how loneliness and isolation (compounding pandemic isolation) escalate in our lives without meaningful in-person conversation. Having a good talk requires our eye contact, warm expressions, listening with empathy, allowing pauses, patience, time to think and thoughtfully respond. If our conversations are shortchanged, distracted, and fragmented, day in and day out, we find ourselves feeling invisible and alone. Instead, could we stand up for the time and full attention we need-- for a good, two-way conversation--for clarification, planning, problem-solving, closure? And better, still, could we make time to tell stories, reminisce, reflect, dream? As a preview of the groups and thought leaders I will be profiling, I would first like to offer a roundup of fifteen essential resources. Over the next year for the Health Story Collaborative, I will be writing in depth about each of these listed below. Kelsey Crowe, Ph.D., Founder, Author,There is No Good Card for This Four years ago, I interviewed Kelsey Crowe for the Health Story Collaborative when her timely and hugely popular book was just released. Now she has teamed up with educators, therapists, and writers, creating Empathy Bootcamp which \"provides practical insights and practices in communication and connection, tailored to your Empathy Type, to help you build trust with your team (and at home).\" Kelsey Crowe earned her PhD in social science from the University of California, Berkeley. She declares on her website that she \"hopes for a day when no one suffers alone because others didn't know what to do or say.\" Tracie Ruble, Founder (Podcast and Service) \"When we hear each other, we change the world by creating belonging, inclusion, and wellness,\" says Tracie Ruble, the founder of Sidewalk Talk. Started in San Francisco, this street initiative is active in most states around the US. Volunteers trained to listen empathically sit on sidewalks with chairs in public places so people can conveniently sit down to talk about what is on their minds. Tracie's podcast features thought leaders on topics ranging from empathy, listening, storytelling, and pandemic-related communication. Sherry Turkle, Ph.D.,Author Renowned media scholar Sherry Turkle examines how diminishing conversation in our culture threatens our relationships and increases anxiety and loneliness. Jean Twenge, Ph.D., Author Jean Twengeis a professor of psychology at San Diego State University and the author of two books and hundreds of articles about the impact of social media on youth. She explores the ways being \"super-connected\" ironically increases loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Further, she encourages families to provide more conversation and engagement in person. \"Common Sense is the nation's leading nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of all kids and families by providing the trustworthy information, education, and independent voice they need to thrive in the 21st century\"--as stated on their website. Founded by Jim Steyer in 2003, Common Sense Media reviews books, movies, TV shows, video games, apps, music, and more. This website is an essential tool for families to provide media guidance for conversation and play within households. Ellen Goodman, Co-Founder Said best on their website, \"The Conversation Project(r) is a public engagement initiative with a goal that is both simple and transformative: to help everyone talk about their wishes for care through the end of life, so those wishes can be understood and respected.\" I look forward to learning more about Ellen Goodman, the co-founder, and formerly a journalist with a fascinating and extensive background. Ana Bess Moyer Bell, Executive Director Ana Bess Moyer Bell was interviewed four years ago for Health Story Collaborative, and I am pleased to provide an update on her exciting new developments. She heads up the initiatives of 2nd Act, Inc, and reports, \"Our mission is to change the way people and communities respond to the impact of substance use through theatre and drama therapy. We envision a world in which all stories are honored and healing is inevitable.\" David Isay, Founder Declared on their website, \"StoryCorps' mission is to preserve and share humanity's stories in order to build connections between people and create a more just and compassionate world.We do this to remind one another of our shared humanity, to strengthen and build the connections between people, to teach the value of listening, and to weave into the fabric of our culture the understanding that everyone's story matters.\" I look forward to profiling their founder David Isay and learning more about how he launched Story Corps at the Grand Central Terminal, New York, in 2003. Ronni Abergel, Founder Imagine sitting down with a complete stranger from a different background in a safe, friendly environment and learning all about his or her life. And further, imagine that this human being is registered with a local library to literally serve as an open book? Indeed, this concept was put into action in Denmark twenty years ago and now The Human Library has reached seven more countries. Their website states: \"The Human Library works to create a safe framework for personal conversations that can help to challenge prejudice, aim to help rid discrimination, prevent conflicts, and contribute to greater human cohesion across social, religious, and ethnic divisions.\" David Pearl and Chris Berez Brown, Co-Founders In a nutshell, Street Wisdom is all about \"inspiration on the go.\" Essentially, this is the wisdom of wandering and learning about the environment around you--just by taking a long walk. Their website explains, \"Street Wisdom is aneveryday creative practiceyou use as you walk. A smart fusion of mindfulness, neuroscience, and wellness, itunlocks our mindsand unblocks our creativity with every step. Suddenly every street is full of inspiration. And whatever our questions, we are findinganswers are everywhere.\" I look forward to writing about David Pearl and Chris Berez Brown who created this whole new approach to walking in cities. Emily Kasriel, Journalist with BBC Crossing Divides, an innovative experiment produced by BBC News Labs, was an interactive news game to give audiences new skills for navigating polarized conversations. Emily Kasriel headed many of these special projects, dedicated to deep listening, hosting difficult discussions, and writing about healing divisions through honest, thoughtful conversations. The Crossing Divides website adds, \"At a time when it's increasingly hard to find common ground, we're bringing people together who disagree and might never normally meet to discuss big issues, like climate change, class, immigration and Brexit...\" The Moth Podcast features re-airs of the Moth Radio Hour and selected archived stories. The Moth Radio Hour is celebrating twenty years of storytelling events. \"By honoring a broad range of individual experiences, we believe we can challenge dominant narratives, deepen connection and create a more productive dialogue around the world.\"--from their website. \"'A podcast about the internet' that is actually an unfailingly original exploration of modern life and how to survive it.\" - The Guardian This podcast airs stories from individuals in everyday life who struggle with the wide, complex world of devices, and often become lost in the mazes of technology. The stories often grapple with ethics, social dilemmas, or humbling predicaments. In short, these stories help those of us who frequently get tangled in the vast, wide web. Ira Glass, Founder Heard by 2.2 million people, this is a highly popular weekly public radio program andpodcast aired on NPR.Each week a theme is chosen and different kinds of stories on that theme are selected. Recent themes have included \"Stuck in the Middle,\" \"The End of the World as We Know It,\" and \"Suitable for Children.\" Ira Glass created this radio program in 1995 and it has won five Peabody Awards for particular episodes over the years. David Morin, Founder According to David Morin who founded Social Pro in 2012, their aim is to provide the \"most actionable, well-researched, and accurate information on how to improve your social life.\" Over 60,000 people receive their newsletter and 400,000 people visit their website each month. Younger adults with social anxiety are particularly attracted to this website that offers useful training for skill development in conversational skills such as how to read social cues.

    "data": "At age 51, Loie was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At the time of this interview, she had just celebrated five years cancer-free. Loie beat the odds. On average, individuals with this disease survive 4-6 months after diagnosis, and only about 6% make it to five years. Early diagnosis is rare, as symptoms can be very subtle, or even nonexistent. All too often, the cancer is locally advanced or has spread outside of the pancreas by the time it is found, and surgery, the only curative treatment, is no longer an option. Even with surgery, prognosis is poor, with five year survival rates ranging from 10-30%. Everyone copes with illness differently. For Loie, focusing on the positive was the key. She didn't want to hear or think about the severity of her condition. In her words, \"I protected myself by not knowing.\" She chose not to read a lot about her cancer, and intentionally avoided the Internet. She decided she was going to get better, and, except in rare and fleeting moments, she did not allow herself to consider other options -- like an early death. In talking to her young son, Chris, Loie decided to tell him that everything would be fine, even though she was well aware of the grim statistics. Loie has been lucky, and her positive attitude has helped her along the way. Listen to Loie's husband, Wayne, and her son, Chris as well, as they share their experiences of having a family member with cancer.

When my best friend Liz passed away fromosteosarcomaafter one year of unsuccessful treatment, her mother asked if I would share something at the service. I seized the opportunity, as it seemed like a potential antidote to the grief roiling inside me. For days, I immersed myself in boxes of photographs and stacks of letters that told the story of our friendship. I spent hours feverishly recording my memories, depicting her mischievous smile, glittering eyes, and elegant voice. On the morning of her service, I rose to the pulpit with quivering hands but a strong heart, and delivered a eulogy that was humorous, commemorative, and authentic.

    "data": "When I was 15 years old, I told my pediatrician that I ate very specific foods at very specific times of the day, and when my eating didn't go exactly to plan, I made myself throw up. She nodded and then left the room. When she came back, she handed me some papers, the same way that my teachers handed out worksheets in class. Each paper was titled with a different word that I didn't recognize. \"You have anorexia and bulimia,\" she said. I remembered how, in middle school, I bought one of those celebrity gossip magazines at the grocery store. The cover featured Demi Lovato, and it talked about how she used to starve herself all day, then eat everything in her cupboard at night, and then make herself throw it all up. I read the words \"binging and purging.\" I remember feeling so sad for her, but thinking it would never happen to me because things that happen to celebrities didn't happen to normal people. So I said to my pediatrician, \"No I don't, because I only do it sometimes.\" I left the doctor's office with my new handouts and a lollipop for my troubles. There was a time when what, when, and why I ate never crossed my mind. But when I was 12, I remember coming home from school with a new fact I'd learned. \"Did you know that when you eat bread, it all just breaks down into sugar in your stomach?\" I said this to my mom, a gastroenterologist. She giggled, enviously, at my simplified outlook on the world. These were the years when I begged my babysitter to take me to Cold Stone every day after lacrosse practice. She'd say, \"Only if you eat the whole thing.\" I would order cotton candy ice cream with fudge, caramel, and gobs of cookie dough. I scraped my cup clean every time, and then I'd make a toasted plain bagel with Nutella at home. When dinner was served shortly thereafter, I'd use my fork to scrape my grilled chicken and broccoli onto my dad's plate. My stomach had no room left, stuffed with foods that I had learned all break down to sugar in the end. My father is a facial plastic surgeon, an expert in making people more attractive. And my mother, the gastroenterologist, knows exactly what to eat to be \"healthy.\" But my parents never tried to fix my 12-year-old diet. When I gave my dinner to my dad each night, I'd call him my garbage disposal, and he'd return a gaze that said,Again?but his judgement ended there. I believe they were concerned about my food waste more than anything. I sustained my Cold-Stone-and-Nutella-bagels diet until I grew breasts in eighth grade. Puberty is terrifying for adolescents. Adults avoid change like a sickness, scared of a new routine and way of being. But in puberty, adolescents have no choice. My shirts that used to drape off my body began to hug my chest, and training bras simply didn't do the trick anymore. I bought bras that were a size too small, to hide them. The worst part was that I was navigating the change alone, as most of my friends still had boards for chests. During puberty, I learned another fact: breasts are made mostly of fat.So, if I was growing breasts, it must have meant that I was getting fat. I told myself this as I entered high school. At 14 years old, I could look 18 with some makeup and a low-cut shirt. Instagram taught me to look and act older than my age, which meant to have breasts, but not too large, and to have a thin waist, but not too thin. After a beach vacation, I posted an edited picture of me in a bikini.Smooth the face, pinch the waist, and enhance the muscles. Fruit and spinach replaced bread and pasta. I convinced myself that I was lactose intolerant so that no one would ask me if I wanted ice cream or \"cheese-on-that?\" My body caught the attention of a boy. He and I were in the same math class. We would FaceTime to do our math homework together, which turned into me doing his math homework for him. I liked him for his charm and the validation that he gave me: if I didn't like my body, at least a boy did. And so, the more attention he gave my body, the more I paid attention to my body, and then he liked my body more, so I liked him more. At the same time, I was flying all over the country for lacrosse camps and tournaments. I played anywhere between 2-8 hours of lacrosse each day. I complained, but I secretly loved how much I got to exercise. I used it as an excuse to eat pasta and bread again. I fueled and refueled my body based off how many hours I exercised. But, lacrosse went on pause in August, so I stopped eating. In 14 days, I lost 15 pounds. One day, I woke up and decided to be lactose intolerant again. I allowed myself to eat celery sticks, hummus, salad, and one egg at a time. I took daily pictures of my waist to document my progress. My waist was never quite thin enough, though; it wouldn't be until I disappeared completely. During this time, my family visited Jackson Hole, Wyoming. While hiking the Tetons, I bought a sandwich with mayonnaise so that it would spoil in the sun, and I would have nothing to eat. I made my family turn around because I was nearly passing out hiking. Feeling guilty about my lack of exercise, I ran four miles when we got back to the hotel. Later that night, my mom came into my hotel room. She lowered herself slowly onto my bed, as if the bed was as delicate as the subject matter at hand. \"Dad and I think you look too thin,\" she said. \"I'm just sick of eating pasta and carbs all the time,\" I lied. \"And I'm not playing lacrosse, so I'm just not as hungry and I just don't look as strong.\" I don't remember the rest of our conversation because the only thing that mattered was that someone called me \"thin.\" There are a few memories from August 2016 that I will never forget. One night, my mom found me with my head in the toilet. We had pizza for dinner, and I was trying to get rid of it. It was the first substantial meal I had eaten in two weeks, and when we locked eyes, our eyes were glossy with understanding. The next morning, my mom asked her friend, an athletic trainer, to come talk to me. I didn't know the word at 15 years old, but this was an intervention. I'm sure he told me all about what, when, why I need to eat, but everything went in one ear and out the other. I ate a piece of cold pizza in front of them to show them I understood. When they made me start eating again, I started running four miles each day. My foot began hurting, but I didn't stop. I was seeing the boy from my math class in a few weeks, and I couldn't lose all the progress I had made. At the end of August, a group of our friends met up at the beach. I was so excited for the boy to see the progress I had made on my body. That night, he had sex with me when I said I didn't want to have sex with him. \"Please,\" he whined. \"Okay,\" I complied. It hurt and I felt suffocated. I felt like a grown woman and a total whore, and I thought that they may be one in the same. At 15 years old, I struggled to comprehend what had happened to me. I spoke few words for a week. I wouldn't let anyone get within an arm's length. Each night, I'd jolt awake, suffocating, hysterical, throwing pillows, punching air, pulling my hair. I'd been cracked in two. I first spoke about the beach incident with my therapist, then my mom. It seemed like everyone knew something I didn't, like I had spinach in my teeth and no one would tell me. I kept running. He didn't love me, which made me want to eat everything, which meant I had to keep running. I ran so much that I broke my foot, and when my foot healed, I made new eating rules. I wasn't allowed to eat carbs after 6PM, unless it was the night before a lacrosse game. The rest of high school came and went like the ocean's tide. I was pummeled at times, pulled into a riptide, overthinking every meal. These times often ended in my eating everything else before I ate what I wanted in the first place. But other times, the water was calm. Eating felt simple; I ate what I wanted until I wanted to stop. During my senior year, I strung along enough calm eating days to convince myself that I had overcome my eating disorders. I had been accepted to Brown where I would play college lacrosse, so food became \"fuel\" for my sport. I wrote my college essay about conquering anorexia and bulimia, and then I gave a speech about it to my entire school. I was the girl who handled adversity, who lived to tell the tale. And then, I relapsed. When the pandemic hit during my first year of college, I was pulled right back into that riptide, trying to equalize my calories to my exercise. That year, I made myself throw up after binging at Christmas dinner. I peered at myself in the mirror afterwards. Through a blurry gaze, I asked myself,Who are you? I am an anorexic and bulimic girl in recovery. I've realized that you don't get over these diseases like the annual flu. They're dormant at times, and they resurface at inconvenient times. Playing college lacrosse helps because anorexia isn't an option: I have to eat to have energy. But--sometimes--my body looks bulkier here, and squishier there, and I restrict my eating accordingly. The looming question lately isWhat happens once lacrosse is over?14 years of using my body to serve a sport all comes to an end this May. I'm entering uncharted territory. Perhaps I'll become the lost 15-year-old again with self-inflicted lactose intolerance. Perhaps I'll revert even younger, back to my blissfully ignorant Cold-Stone-and-Nutella-bagels diet. Or perhaps, I'll stay in this space where I look in the mirror and finally say, \"Okay.\" About the Author Nathalie is currently a senior at Brown University.

    "data": "Sara and Kerry met as students at Bates College in 2001. They were together for eight years, and planned to get married in August 2010. Last June, just two months before the wedding, Kerry committed suicide using a gun he purchased legally that same day. He was 27 years old. This was a complete surprise to everyone who knew him, and obviously devastating. At the time, both Sara and Kerry were in graduate school in the Northwest: Sara was in Seattle, Washington, getting a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology, and Kerry was in Eugene, Oregon attending law school and pursuing a concurrent masters degree in conflict and dispute resolution. They completed their studies late last spring, full of energy, ambition and promise, and were planning to move back east before the wedding, for their careers and to be closer to Sara's family in Maine. For Kerry, the move never happened. Kerry had been plagued by chronic pain in his arms, back, and legs for over a year. As a student, he did not have cohesive medical care, which meant he saw multiple providers and had to tell his story over and over again. The cause of Kerry's pain was never determined. None of his physicians had followed him over time, and none knew him well as a result. Kerry was not one to complain about pain, and indeed, until he developed these debilitating conditions, he had been an athlete in excellent physical health. At times, given the lack of a clear diagnosis, he felt that the legitimacy of his pain was called into question. Ultimately, he was left with a sense of desperation and hopelessness. Suicide is a major public health problem. According to 2007 data, it is the 11th leading cause of death overall and 4th leading cause of death for adults 18 to 65 in the United States. Everyday, approximately 90 Americans commit suicide. What can be done to prevent suicides like Kerry's? Recently, Sara and Kerry's father, Dr. Mike Lewiecki, addressed this issue in an article, \"Time to Reconsider,\" published last month in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Here, Sara (who is now a post-doctoral fellow in molecular biology at Massachusetts General Hospital) speaks openly about her experience of Kerry's suicide, and about trying to move forward in the face of such a tragic loss.

    "data": "Chris Davie died on January 8, 2019, at the age of 41. He was diagnosed with a grade 2 Glioma--a brain tumor--on the last day of 2007, when he had an unexpected seizure in the car with his wife Betsy and baby son Nathan, on their way to a New Year's Eve party. It was a frigid Minnesota night; luckily, Betsy was driving. The diagnosis was a shock and the initial treatments--including brain surgery-- grueling, but he was told his life expectancy with this type of tumor could be 10 to 20 years, and this seemed like a long time. \" I know this is the real world, that this is terminal,\" he recalls thinking, \"but I am going to do my best to go 20 years.\" Despite regular medical checks, life went on as usual, for the most part, for the next 10 years. But in 2017 the tumor started to grow again and, after a second brain surgery, the tumor was re-classified as a Grade IV Glioblastoma, a diagnosis with an average life expectancy of 15 months. The cancer was no longer \"surreal,\" as it had been for so many years. Suddenly, it was a reality with a frighteningly short time-line. Betsy Davie, Chris' wife, contacted me by email in early June, 2018. She had learned about Health Story Collaborative after watching alive-streamed story event,co-hosted by CaringBridge, featuring Michael Bischoff, another patient living with Glioblastoma, and his neuro-oncologist, Dr. John Trusheim. Betsy and Chris resonated with Michael's story and were motivated to reach out. \"Chris is in a tough spot medically,\" she wrote. \"The last few months have been difficult. To be transparent, the tumor is affecting his ability to communicate, particularly in written form, which is why I am writing to you. In the last month we have discussed, at length, the importance of being more open with family, friends, and possibly the wider community. We are exploring ways for him to tell and share his story while he still can.\" We met in August to record their story. Chris was clear on his goals. He wanted to capture a record of his experience, to communicate what he was going through, what he had learned and what had been meaningful to him. Most importantly, he wanted his kids, Nathan, now 11, and Julia, now 7, to remember him and to know, deeply, how much he loved them and how much their love meant to him. During our conversation, he mentioned a song that has been important to his family--\"The One Who Knows,\" by Dar Williams. A quote from this song hangs on the wall in the hallway between his children's bedrooms, where it has been for years. \"You'll fly away, but take my hand until that day,\" it begins, \"So when they ask how far love goes, when my job's done, you'll be the one who knows.\" He knew that he would fly away first, before they are grown, but the message still pertains. While on his way out of this world, Chris worked actively and intentionally to deepen his connections and to make his love known. Michael Bischoff, who, without his knowledge, led Chris and Betsy to me, also has young children, and has also committed himself to doing what he can now, before it's too late, to share his story and deepen his relationships. Michael reflects on his first experience sharing his story in community as follows: \"I was putting my trust in the healing power of bringing forth what is inside of me, not in thinking that it will magically cure me of cancer, but in trusting that bringing together my internal and external worlds will bring me closer to life, and connect the sometimes-lonely landscape of moving through brain cancer with other people I care about.\" Michael is now part of the Health Story Collaborative team, our Healing Story Principal, guiding others in storytelling and leading by example. He has taught me that it is possible to heal even in the face of death. He has demonstrated the power of connection. If we fully own and openly express our vulnerability, the imagined walls that keep us separate often disappear. At Health Story Collaborative, our work centers on using storytelling as a therapeutic tool. We work closely with individuals navigating health challenges to help them construct and share their narratives in ways that are psychologically productive and empowering. Our approach is grounded in research supporting the health benefits of storytelling. We encourage the development of certain narrative themes that have been linked to improvements in mental health, namely agency, communion, redemption and coherence. But the people we work with keep it real. It is not always possible to have a sense of agency in the throes of illness. And not everything is redeemable. It can't get worse than death. And yet, Chris and Michael, two men with Glioblastoma, a deadly brain tumor, have given me hope and inspiration. They remind me: it is not all or nothing. Even when death is imminent, we can look for threads of redemption and flashes of agency. We do what we can, and we do it with love. We nurture and celebrate our communities and connections. We give voice to what is in our minds and hearts. We expose our humanity. They remind us. If this isn't healing, what is?

    "data": "By Pam Saylor When early retirement unexpectedly became an option in 2016, my husband Dave and I dusted off our long-planned dream trip and made our plans to travel in Europe for a year, beginning in Italy. Like giddy kids, we bought two one-way tickets to Rome. Despite the excitement, I almost immediately felt overwhelmed. After all, I had been a Type 1 diabetic for only three years and still had a lot to learn. How would I buy insulin and would it be affordable? Would my prescriptions in English be accepted in European pharmacies? But excitement, anticipation and a bit of courage kept me going. Pushing worries aside, in the fall of 2017 we left the U.S. hauling four suitcases and one beer cooler full of insulin. My carry-on suitcase was full of stockpiled insulin supplies. I had asked my endocrinologist a thousand questions and made lists of everything I thought I needed to know. As we traveled things fell into place. I easily filled prescriptions in Rome and Croatia. Of course, there were some problems, like when the Croatian Customs office blocked my Omnipod insulin pumps from being delivered. I reluctantly went back to giving myself multiple daily insulin injections. After Croatia, we landed in London and I was thrilled to receive a shipment of insulin pumps from my daughter so I could quit the daily injections. Early one morning I attached a Pod to my arm and we headed out for a day of exploring. I checked my blood sugar repeatedly and all day my numbers were perfect. After we returned to our apartment that afternoon I sat on the couch to watch TV and Dave went to the bedroom to read. When I opened my eyes, the afternoon was gone and there was darkness outside the windows. I must have been sleeping. Across the room, a pair of shoes was lying in the corner, but they looked wrong somehow--blurry and dim. I blinked. The shoes moved toward me and then away--then closer again before receding. The walls wobbled and looked like they were melting. My brain couldn't think of the word \"shoes.\" My head swung to the right and my husband, pale and wide-eyed, was sitting next to me on the couch. His voice shook as he described finding me on the couch--unresponsive but still breathing. Taking a test strip from my purse, he tested my blood sugar. It was only 20. He knew what to do. Every year we looked at the bright red plastic case holding the emergency glucagon kit after I bought a new one. When he found me unconscious on the couch, Dave knew the glucagon was the only thing that could save me. He filled the syringe and plunged the long needle into my thigh. We were both silent as we took an Uber to the nearby hospital. I was cold and exhausted. Talking took too much effort. Thinking took too much effort. My arms and legs each weighed 100 pounds. At the hospital, we eventually saw a doctor. He had questions. From my purse, I pulled out the Personal Diabetes Manager that operated my insulin pump and answered all of his questions. But my hands shook as I searched the PDM. I had questions too. How did this happen? What did I do wrong? The doctor meant well but he didn't have any answers to give me. Like many doctors and nurses, he didn't understand diabetes very well. We collected a prescription for another emergency glucagon kit and took an Uber home. I lowered my pump settings and nervously went to bed. When I was finally able to talk to my endocrinologist she told me that I had accidentally given myself an insulin overdose and that I should have reduced my basal insulin settings on the pump for the first 24 hours after re-attaching the pump. Before we set out on our trip I thought I had asked every question, planned every detail, limited every risk, prepared for every situation. But life isn't entirely predictable and my best-laid plans and my carefully drafted lists couldn't always protect me. Life is for living--risks and all. After my hospital experience, I was thankful. Thankful that Dave was there and knew what to do. Thankful we had not let my worry or fear keep us home. If we hadn't gone on our year-long dream trip, if we had clung to the safety and security of home, I would have regretted it. Pam is a retired paralegal and a contented travel addict. She wrote a book about her year of traveling to help others with diabetes who want to travel. Learn more atwww.bravingtheworldbook.com. .",

    "data": "My mistakes are like wildfires: disfiguring the entire landscape, forests turned black and flat and charred beneath my feet. After something like that, people will always look at you like a walking natural disaster, always smell the air for smoke. I would do anything to take it back, to just pop the cap back on that bottle and move on with my life, but that didn't happen. There's that saying about something being a tough pill to swallow, but I guess I never had that problem. Pills were easy. Too easy. The summer before I started high school, my dad and I moved to a small town in rural Oregon. It was deceptively picturesque, with a historic downtown and snow-capped mountains lining the horizon. My dad said it looked like a Christmas card, but to me, it felt like a snow globe. \"Come on, it's a fresh start in God's country. It'll be good for us,\" he said. I knew the divorce hadn't been easy on my dad, but this didn't feel like a fresh start. It felt like a life sentence. The town felt barren. Untouched. Lonely. Of course, there were other kids my age in the town, and I went to school with all of them. You'd think this would help with the overwhelming isolation, but it had the opposite effect. Throwing together a few hundred chronically bored, desperate-for-trouble teens is about as good of an idea as it sounds. It became us against the world, a case study in desperation and mob mentality. Without that anger and desire for more, what did we have? There was nothing for us to look forward to besides escape. Every day in that tiny school and that tiny town felt the same, like we were living in a time loop. It would almost be cool, like a science fiction movie, if it wasn't so abysmally boring. So we determined that if we couldn't get to the outside world just yet, we would bring the outside world to us. Like the stupid kids we were, we thought the outside world was like one giant rager, so we threw some pretty killer parties. I never understood how the word \"killer\" could both mean something good and bad at the same time. Now I do. Flash forward to a Friday night sometime during my senior year. We had survived yet another week of classes and teachers and homework; graduation was just around the corner. We were so close to being done. So close. Naturally, we decided to celebrate the only way we knew how: we threw a party. We kept the house dark, the music loud, and the blinds drawn. For those few brief hours in whoever's house we were crashing that weekend, we weren't trapped in rural Oregon. We were living in L.A. or New York or some other far away city. Our hearts slammed inside our chests, echoing the beat of the music and chanting for more, more, more. For those few brief hours, we were free. Freedom has a price, though. That's the part they skip in the movies. The characters have a crazy night, something goes wrong, chaos ensues as the characters try to fix whatever sticky situation they had gotten themselves into, the problem works itself out, and the characters laugh about it afterwards and have a sentimental moment. Cue happy music. Roll credits. The end. That's not how it happens in real life. That night, we made a mistake. We started a wildfire. The moment my friend switched out a beer bottle for a pill bottle, I should have known to walk away. I should have said no, but that night, I felt invincible. I thought nothing would hurt me, not when I was so close to my life finally starting. I looked around at all my friends, drunk and high and so alive, and I took one. Oxycodone didn't sound scary, not like heroin or cocaine or meth. They gave it to kids when they got their teeth pulled, so how bad could it be? One pill wouldn't hurt. I had stopped saying no a long time ago. If only I had known that one pill would turn into a habit, and a habit would turn into a full blown addiction. Soon, I had pills in my locker, in my car, in my bookbag, in my purse. Any space I inhabited on a regular basis became my drug cabinet, my hiding place. It became increasingly difficult, however, to keep my addiction going. I was in high school, and my dad would be furious if he found out. I didn't have nearly enough money to keep buying the pills I wanted--no, needed. I found myself at a new low. Hooked on the high and stupid enough to keep my problem a secret, I used up the last of my money from my summer job and bought heroin for the first time. It was from a kid at my school; the deal was cheap and quick. The needle was intimidating at first, but not as scary as the thought of withdrawal. The tremors, the sweating, the chills, the pain. Itching for a high in the tiny bathroom attached to my bedroom, I closed my eyes to not focus on the pinch of the needle. I didn't think about what would happen once this high wore off. I just let the wave of euphoria wash over me and felt a sudden calm. Looking in the mirror, I could see my first bruise already beginning to show. I changed into a sweatshirt before my dad came home. I would wear long sleeves for years to come. If taking oxycodone for the first time crossed a line, shooting up with heroin for the first time obliterated it. Every day, the drugs worked less and less, and I had to buy more and more. I was covered in bruises. Anywhere that could be hidden with jeans or long sleeves was a canvas of blue and brown bruises and puncture marks. If there was anything drugs taught me, it was that I was a good liar. It seemed I could hide anything from my dad. Until three years later, when I finally hit rock bottom. I was in college. I mean, I was enrolled in college, but I rarely even showed up to class. My grades were slipping and my attendance was a disaster, but I could never seem to make it through the day. Not without getting high. I'd gone home early that day, exhausted and ready to add another bruise to the collection. If I had counted how many times I had felt the sting of a needle, it probably would have been enough to have given myself a full tattoo. One minute I was in the bathroom, pulling my sleeves down to hide the shameful thing I had just done, and the next, I had stumbled into my room. I laid down and closed my eyes, which is apparently how my dad found me. Prone. Unresponsive. Barely breathing. I woke up a day later in the hospital, my dad sitting next to the hospital bed with his head in his hands. He lifted his head and looked at me, my eyes red and bloodshot. He didn't say anything. He just looked at me. I told him it wasn't his fault, but I could tell he didn't believe me. He felt the burden of my secret as much as I did. He sat there and looked at my arms, a stark picture of my addiction. He checked me into rehab the next week. Rehab was not like the hospital. The hospital was cold and smelled like rubbing alcohol and formaldehyde. It was sterile and felt like death. Rehab, on the other hand, was filled with warm colors and art classes and friendly faces. Withdrawal felt like dying, but at least it wasn't death. It was resuscitation. Revival. Resurrection. I left a month later detoxified and rejuvenated, ready to pick up the pieces of my life and live as if that night at that fated party never happened. Too bad good things almost never last. I would overdose three more times. Each time, my dad sent me back to rehab with a little less hope in his eyes. I had given up a little, too. During my fourth stint in rehab, I met Rachel. She was nineteen, bone thin, and pregnant. It turns out that if you do heroin while you're pregnant, the baby gets addicted, too. If the mom tries to go cold turkey and stop feeding her addiction, the baby also goes through withdrawal and can die. So there sat Rachel, medicated on methadone and just waiting until her nine-and-a-half month wait was up so that she could get her act together. When I asked her about her situation, she said, \"If it was just me, I probably would have never gotten clean. But it's not just me anymore, and Child Protective Services can get involved at any time. My family doesn't think I'll make a good mom. I need to prove them wrong. I just made a mistake. It was one time.\" It was this heartbreaking admission that made me see that if I didn't get clean, I could be in Rachel's shoes in five, ten, maybe fifteen years. I could never drag my kids into this. Never. That was my last trip to rehab. I never touched a needle again. Five Years Later \"And that's how I got here. I'm almost five years clean, and I'm finishing community college in a couple of months. I already have a job lined up after I graduate.\" Claps and congratulations filled the room as I announced this news, a success story that the other recovering addicts in the room could aspire to. Heroin Anonymous had taken up my Monday nights for the past four years, and in every meeting I attended I felt like I was earning my place back in society. Rachel sat across the room with her daughter, who was fast asleep in her lap. I wondered if Rachel would ever tell her what these meetings were, who she used to be. My father sat next to me, smiling and proud of my recovery. It is true that some mistakes are like wildfires. They burn down everything that was once familiar, and you are left with only the ashes. But that's the incredible thing about wildfires: after the flames have died down and the heat no longer persists, the scorched ground becomes green again. Life always finds a way. Things grow back. It may never be the same, but it sure is something worthwhile. Shannon Lally is currently pursuing a double major in Psychology BS and English with a concentration in Creative Writing. After college, she hopes to pursue law in a creative field, such as book publication.",

    "data": "By Leah Meyer As a social worker at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Sandy often works with young adults who receive potentially life-threatening diagnoses. \"I think it's absolutely jarring\", she reflects on the experience, though not solely in her capacity as a provider. Sandy was diagnosed, herself, with bilateral breast cancer when she was 35. That first year included bilateral mastectomies, two different kinds of chemotherapy, and radiation. Then followed 15 years of hormonal therapy, so \"technically\", she states, \"I didn't end treatment until a little more than a year ago.\" Though cancer doesn't affect her day to day existence anymore, it has certainly not disappeared from her life. She refers to it, wryly, as \"the gift that keeps on giving.\" She still sees the oncologist every year and waits anxiously for the results of her annual blood tests, and her history as a cancer survivor has forever shifted her self-perception and the way that others perceive of her. When reflecting on her own treatment, Sandy thinks of the work she does with people in recovery from addiction, citing the value of the \"one day at a time\" philosophy prominent in 12-step treatment models. \"I really took my cancer diagnosis and took life a day at a time...I think I was already living that way in part because of the work that I did,\" she recalls, but cancer made this way of life even more pressing. Early in her diagnosis, soon after completing the most aggressive stage of her treatment, she remembers that she stopped saving in her 401K. \"In part\", she says, \"because you wonder, am I gonna be around for retirement?\" She wanted to spend her money, to go on fun trips and do the things she had always dreamed of doing. Nowadays, with the fear of recurrence less of a constant in her mind, she has shifted her perspective slightly. \"I have to make plans for tomorrow, but I have to live in today.\" And so it comes back around, her experience in return informing her work. \"I think it's actually helped me be a better social work provider because I know both sides...you know what it's like.\" She urges providers not to make assumptions about patients and their priorities, as she herself experienced when preparing for her own double mastectomy. Sandy, who is a lesbian and an accomplished athlete, recalls that one of her doctors made a comment on how the surgery would give her the \"athletic body\" that she had always wanted. \"That was what I wanted? No,\" she corrects, \"I'd rather have my boobs.\" Some of the memorable lessons Sandy holds close required a different kind of strength from her usual persistence and fighter's attitude. As an example, she remembers attempting to tackle a strenuous ropes course as part of an Outward Bound community building activity with her breast cancer support group while in the midst of treatment. Always one to try the hardest route, she fell her first time through, but she got up and tried again, this time taking a gentler approach. \"Sometimes the easier way is the better way,\" she realized, and she has carried this lesson forward. She has found the humor in her experiences too, believing that \"you can do stand-up comedy about some of the things\" that cancer brings along, telling the story of a prosthetic breasts mishap on the golfing range. And there's always new material. You have to keep laughing. As for advice to others navigating similar health challenges, Sandy says \"don't let it stop you.\" She acknowledges that you may have to \"accommodate\" the cancer, but you can (and must) keep going. \"You can have aggressive cancer and aggressive treatment and still get better,\" she reminds us. Also, she encourages people undergoing treatment to identify what kind of support is helpful and to seek it out. Personally, she finds the hushed, knowing prompts of \"how ARE you?\" annoying, but knows that some people like to be asked. \"Whatever works for you, teach your friends,\" she urges, \"find community.\" Finally, and perhaps most importantly, \"try to celebrate each day.\" Some days, Sandy remembers, \"I was miserable, I was sick as a dog. But I still tried to put good things in each day no matter how crappy I felt, and that made it easier to get through.\" Dr. Annie Brewster, a Boston internist and founder of the Health Story Collaborative.

    "data": "By Liz Fullwood The mice never developed the wordsfreedom,earnest,envy. I am a scientist. I am supposed to create change. I hear my family, my mentors raving about my work and how I will bring a better tomorrow. \"Make sure you solve Alzheimer's before I'm too old,' my aunt jests. \"I can't wait to see how you revolutionize medicine,\" my grandmother coos. Yet, day in and day out, I go into the lab, observe the behavior of my mice, do an analysis, and then go home; Nothing changes. This cycle repeats over and over and over again, but it's not just the 9-5 job that cages me. Culture is claustrophobic; Nothing ever satiates this tasteless haze of desire. Our motives and minds are driven by the undying hunger for achievement and the fruitless life-long pursuit of happiness. Why do we frantically accomplish but listlessly live? We are asked what we want to be, and what goals we want to reach, never considering the alternative; I don't want either. I am an orca at SeaWorld, trained to perform, to please-- but even if the hoop changes, it's still the same jump at the end of the day. How long am I expected to perform the act in which I was trained? I am grateful for my privileged experience, and I am still looking for a way out of the enclosure they call the modern lifestyle. In a way, I am jealous of the enclosure the mice in my research facility dwell in. The lab mice have food, clean water, housing, toys, trained professionals to look after their health, and a quick and painless death. They are never aware that they could be aware, and they never dream of anything outside their containment. Their suffering is brief, and they have a higher quality of life than most humans. The world is falling apart, and all we are doing is filming it. Both the forest and the tongues of the people are on fire. Children are dying, the rich keep getting richer, and water is not deemed a human right. Currently, my transfeminine, Jewish girlfriend is struggling to find housing due to the current political climate. I work over 50 hours a week to pay for a place to sleep and to put food on the table; It is never enough. I can't help but wonder if there is more to life than this. Lab mice may be poked, prodded, and undergo experimentation but they are never expected to be more than what they are. All I want is to be human. Yet, I can only actively be another cog in the capitalist machine; that is how you survive. In today's society, you can't have achievement without sacrifice, you can't have love without grief, and you can't have pleasure without addiction. So where does one go when chaos is all there is outside? One folds within. My bed is a foam pit and my spirit toddles on a tightrope of dysphemism. All I want is to curl up and dissolve in the innocuous embrace of my lover. I want to exist in each breath we breathe together and be free of my own head space. My psychiatrist deems it depression and writes me a note for happy pills, but that's not it. I've been to the pits of despair and lived my middle and high school years in a constant state of apathy. This current hopelessness has too much yearning; is this grief? I lay on the navy-blue couch in my 3rd -floor apartment and watch as traffic passes by. The sirens that used to put me on edge are now just dull background noise. I turn on my phone and scroll through Instagram. Terror, death, destruction, cute pets, and the latest pop culture gossip all held on my tiny screen. Everyone has a cause they are fighting for, an opinion that you are not supposed to disagree with. I can't help but wonder if being humane is not the practice of quiet benevolence but rather perfecting the art of scratching a phantom itch. Scientists say creatures are born performing the skill that is essential to survival: giraffes are born walking, sharks are born swimming, and humans are born crying for help. The mice live in isolation and are never able to form their own mischief. I have a community. There are people in my life who listen to me, who actively care for me. In this I am blessed. This world may be exhausting, and life may be a sexually transmitted disease that ultimately ends in death, but unlike the mice, I am not alone. I have been able to find people who are now close to kin. They are my motivation each and every day to get out of bed, to work the 9 to 5. I feel like blunt scissors, desperately trying to make a difference but never able to fulfill the one thing I was made to do. Yet, I am held, someone decided to give me a chance and then kept me around. So, thank you, all of you, for showing me love and compassion. Each laugh and every cuddle bring me hope for a better tomorrow. The mice will never understand the bliss of their situation, but they know to be content with their enclosure. So, though it drains me, I will do my best to be content with mine. Author Statement I search for understanding how to operate in today's world I found that we have domesticated ourselves.

    "data": "By Lori Daniels Krummen I don't generally consider myself an anxious person - but to my surprise, I found myself unable to sleep especially during those first few weeks. And then there was that new dry cough - was that COVID, or all that Lysol everywhere? What about that heart pounding for a bit longer than it should after I raced up the stairs, late for yet another COVID planning meeting? Was it too much caffeine today? (I asked for half caff - they wrote \"1-2 caff\" on my cup. I think they gave me a double shot instead!) Is that why my heart is pounding and I'm sweating? I had been in the hospital daily, around nurse managers and housestaff who later spiked fevers (but tested negative!) Like most around me in the hospital, every symptom that would barely register under normal times was now a potential COVID diagnosis. I had just finished a half-month block attending on the inpatient cardiology service, which meant I wouldn't be leading daily rounds again for at least a month (assuming no surge...), and though I was still seeing clinic patients, mostly remotely, and was working daily on our Division and ICU COVID plans and protocols, I found myself wanting to do more. Twitter feeds about the SARS-CoV2 use of the ACE2 receptor pointed me toward preliminary studies out of China, and more reading, which led me to develop a collaboration between colleagues at our 4 sister University of California Medical Centers. It started with a 9pm Friday night phone call to our Chief Medical and Informatics Officer, which led to a connection with data analysts and a weekend of meetings and spreadsheets. By Monday at 8am I had IRB approval and a (deidentified) working dataset of all UCSD patients tested for COVID, and their relevant medical data. Record time. For me, that weekend epitomizes the good of what COVID is bringing out in us. Our community is becoming stronger. I saw how eager everyone is to pitch in and help, in whatever way they can. The answer, from everyone, was \"yes\". Weekend meetings, working early morning and late-night hours, writing proposals, getting approvals, joining forces, going above and beyond - yes, yes, and yes. We are all pulling together. On a personal level, with no sport or science Olympiad teams to coach, no school lunches to pack, no girl scout meetings or drama clubs or practices of any sort to shuttle the kids to - I suddenly have time to not only dive into research, but also to be with my family. We go on bike rides. We made a family movie about the lockdown. I cook (sorry, kids! And yes, a non-COVID reason to have GI distress). And now, though I am back on service in the hospital, the long clinical hours combined with the research keeps me motivated and hopeful. I still think and worry about those in cities hit much harder than ours, and wish I could do more to help. But the small part that I am doing, and the joint effort that others are freely giving around me, provide me with something to focus on - and now I barely even notice my dry cough anymore.

    "data": "I have taken approximately 2,604 birth control pills in my life. Every night for almost seven years, the incessant alarm on my phone sounds at 10pm reminding me to grab my water bottle and swallow my pill. They are a consistent aspect of my life, which being on a first-name-basis friendship with the pharmacist at my local Walgreens epitomizes. They feel like a core part of me, determining when, where, and how I start to bleed. I began taking them in the seventh grade to regulate my hormones in order to control acne. Contrary to popular belief, I am not alone in this, as many women use birth control to regulate their periods, lessen their cramps, and curtail the debilitating symptoms of PMS. My experience with these pills has been tumultuous, to say the least. At first, I could not say enough about their strength and success. My skin was clear, I knew exactly when my periods were starting, and I felt so grown-up taking a pill from an aluminum case every day. But that honeymoon period (pun intended) did not last long. About six months after taking my first pill, I returned to the doctor that had initially prescribed them. The pills were changing who I was as a person. My entire family had noticed that the week before my period, I became withdrawn and extremely moody, crying multiple times a day. At first, this was attributed to a combination of cliche teenage mood swings and PMS. However, it wasn't long until the characteristics that had defined my personality- a quick sense of humor, a happy-go-lucky attitude, and a passion for pulling pranks- had all but disappeared. To my shock, my doctor explained that this was not unusual or uncommon for women taking oral contraceptives. She told me we could experiment with different formulas of pills, but some bodies simply could not handle the pills. I was devastated. I have tried eight different kinds of birth control pills with varying levels of success. Although an inconvenience in my life, I came to terms over the years with the pill being a core aspect of my womanhood. But after spending a semester enrolled in Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies exploring why women deserve more than what society often expects them to accept, I have come to believe that we deserve more from our birth control products. My experience is not unique. Women have learned to expect serious side-effects with any form of birth control. These side-effects include, but are not limited to: nausea, weight fluctuations, headaches, anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Strangely, there is no outrage about this extreme failure in medication efficacy. In the US, 62% of women are currently on some form of birth control, yet any action being taken to improve it is underfunded and under-appreciated. Women accept less effective medications with more side effects because we, as a society, have learned to be comfortable with a lower standard of care for women. Widespread apathy towards women's health is extremely evident when one looks at a recent study experimenting with men's birth control. In this study, 320 men were given birth control shots every night for eight weeks, in an effort to share out the responsibility of avoiding unwanted pregnancies. The sample considered men of varying backgrounds and levels of sexual activity. Despite potentially optimistic results, we will never see this study brought to fruition. It was halted due to the men experiencing \"severe\" side effects, such as mood swings and acne. Prior to the termination of the study, many women were hopeful that men's birth control was finally a solution to their own undesirable experiences. However, the scientists would not allow men to endure these negative side effects for even eight weeks, when millions of women experience them for the entirety of their reproductive years. This begs the question of why society is untroubled by the less than ideal standard of care given to women yet does not believe it is acceptable for men to tolerate comparable experiences. The lack of women in STEM careers, a reluctance to believe women's symptom descriptions, and a greed-driven pharmaceutical industry are all connected to this double standard. The compounding of these three elements creates structural inequalities in healthcare that put women in physical danger and must be addressed sooner rather than later. Women are underrepresented and undervalued in STEM careers. I am a two-year member of WashU's Women in STEM Club, which aims to increase support and mentoring for women in STEM fields so that they can be better prepared to endure the journey ahead of them. As a college student aspiring to have a future career in the field of medicine, this cause directly affects the trajectory of my life. A 2013 study called \"What's So Special about STEM? A Comparison of Women's Retention in STEM and Professional Occupations\" explored the environment faced by women in different careers. The results found that women in STEM have a statistically significant increased tendency to remove themselves from their fields. Due to careful consideration of any confounding variables, the study uncovered that the main cause for the mass exodus from upper STEM fields by women is not due to children, as many people tend to believe, but rather because of a \"hostile work environment.\" This unsustainable work environment is evident at a well-known and iconic leader in the technology field, Google headquarters. In August of 2017, an executive engineer penned an internal memo to the entirety of Google named, \"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber.\" In this memo, the employee explains that women are biologically more predisposed to neuroticism, have less drive for higher status, and are more agreeable than assertive. He claims, \"This may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist and to the lower number of women in high stress jobs.\" He later explains that accommodations should never be made for any employees on the basis of gender or race, as the only reason women and minority groups are underrepresented in tech is because of \"biological disadvantages.\" This memo went unaddressed by Google leadership for many days. Eventually, an apologetic email that contained plans for improvement was sent out to the company staff, but the damage was already done. Women's perspectives are integral to the creation of a successful product for women, yet the vast majority of scientists creating, testing, and marketing birth control products are men. I believe men cannot possibly comprehend the debilitating side effects of birth control pills, and therefore will not fight as hard as women would to find a solution. Because of this, it is essential that we encourage and support young women considering careers in science-which must occur early in a girl's life. A 2004 research study done by Patricia VanLeuvan uncovered that there is a massive dip in interest in science careers of young girls between the seventh grade and the first year of high school. Careers that have better representation of women, such as medicine and biological sciences, experienced a lesser decrease in interest than less represented fields, such as engineering. This research shows that when one generation of women are inspired to pursue fields in STEM, a domino effect will result in the coming generations. A recent episode of Grey's Anatomy, one of my personal favorite shows, explored society's shortcomings at recognizing and treating women's self-reported symptoms . Dr. Miranda Bailey, a world-renowned and extremely respected Chief of Surgery, goes to a rival hospital's ER and calmly explains that she believes she is having a heart attack. The ER doctors and cardiologists, all her friends and all white males, immediately begin questioning her history of OCD and anxiety, blaming these disorders as the reason for her symptoms. Chief Bailey responds with authority and confidence, relaying that heart attacks often manifest themselves differently in women, with symptoms such as shortness of breath without pain, anxiety attacks, and jaw and neck pain. Even with her expertise and obvious medical savviness, the other doctors refuse to believe her until her heart literally stops beating for two minutes. It is no wonder that doctors regularly disregard women's self-reported symptoms, when Dr. Miranda Bailey, one of the most beloved doctors in the TV world, was not believed when she described her condition. A study aptly named, \"The Girl Who Cried Pain,\" exposed the unfortunate truth that female patients are \"more likely to be treated less aggressively in their initial encounters with the health-care system until they 'prove that they are as sick as male patients.\" This statement translates more tangibly to a nationwide average 49-minute wait time for men compared to a 65-minute wait time for women after reporting the same acute abdominal pain in an ER. The lower standard of care given to women who choose to take birth control is ignored by those who have the power to improve it, specifically a greed-driven pharmaceutical industry. \"Big pharma\" makes billions of dollars every year off of birth control products, including pills, IUDs, vaginal rings, patches, and shots. These profit margins are only increased by women trying multiple versions of each product, as they are forced to do when side effects are too debilitating for them to function. These profits serve as positive reinforcement for big pharma to continue making imperfect products. For many years, big pharma companies have gotten away with imperfect pills, knowing that they are the preferred choice of birth control for sexually active women. A recent study in the UK shows that these tides are turning. Bayer Healthcare, a leader in the market of contraception products, conducted a research study investigating women's attitude towards varying forms of birth control. This research was confirmed by the Office of National Statistics, and found that 31% of women chose, at some point in their lives, to switch from the pill to Long Acting Reversible Contraception, or LARC's. These women were totally unsatisfied with the side effects and overall effectiveness of the pill and decided that their bodies and minds deserved better. Society has taught women to expect a lower standard of care from all healthcare providers, ranging from doctors to CEO's of pharmaceutical companies. This custom is dangerous for the physical and mental well-being of women, which further effects all aspects of society. Therefore, it is time that we, as women, demand more for ourselves. We deserve birth control that does its job with no side effects. We deserve to be heard when we go to the Emergency Room asking for help. We deserve to be represented in fields that make decisions about our health. We deserve (birth) control. \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper.\" Grey's Anatomy, season 14, episode 11, ABC, 1 Feb. 2018. https://www.hulu.com/watch/1215330.

    "data": "Another Conversation with Robyn Houston-Bean, Founder and Director, The Sun Will Rise Foundation By Val Walker In our first interview, Robyn shared how the support from her grief counselor, her friends, and her support group had all helped to hold her through her darkest months after her son's overdose. Nearly a year after his death, she discovered that community action was her path to healing, and started her own support group in Braintree, MA. Soon she launched The Sun Will Rise Foundation. Her insights about how support groups and community service can empower us after a tragedy sparked a whole new conversation. Val: Can you describe what gave you a sense of purpose a few months after Nick's death? Robyn: After a few months of grieving, I attended an event with a group called Hand Delivered Hope that does street outreach for those living with active addiction and who call the streets home. Joining in with other families and feeling so welcomed and accepted, it suddenly struck me that I had a sense of purpose: My child was not here anymore, but I could help another child. Although my Nick wasn't here, someone else's child needed my love and support. This warm, friendly group and others, such as Let It Out and The Boston Grief Group, inspired me and gave me strength to start my own group in Braintree. I knew we needed a grief support group closer to where I lived because I finally realized the scope of all this grief out there in the world. It's so important that support groups are convenient for local people to meet and come together easily. We need people to understand us and validate our feelings, so we don't have to make excuses for our tears and our laughter. Val: I would love to learn more about how helping others is healing for you. Robyn: To put it simply, helping others helps me. I know that if I didn't go down the path of helping others, I would be at a different place with my grief. Helping others forces me to step out of my own pain and hear and feel the grief of others. The group members are so appreciative to have a place to put their grief. Nick was so compassionate and caring, and each time someone is helped with our group, I know he is smiling down on me. Val: It amazes me that you went straight to the Braintree Town Hall to ask about starting a support group. How did this happen? Robyn: I knew a person who worked for the mayor, so I floated the idea of having a group at the town hall. Right away that person thought it was a great thing for our town to do. What a perfect way to say \"no\" to the stigma about the opioid crisis by having this group right at the Braintree Town Hall! After the group was going for a while, we had our first fundraiser for the foundation right there at the town hall. We have been lucky because not all communities have embraced the idea that substance use disorder can happen to anyone, and that we all need to work together to help prevent it. Val: What was it like learning to be a group facilitator? Robyn: I doubted myself very much at the beginning, but I received such great support from some of the facilitators. My doubts were erased very quickly. Figuring out the logistics, learning about facilitating, getting the word out so people in grief could find a tribe--all this kept my mind busy and kept me going in the early days. Val: How is having a purpose contagious with other families affected by the opioid epidemic? Robyn: I'm amazed how powerful it can be when people who are usually on the margins are given a voice. Grieving is hard enough, but on top of that, it's a stigmatizing death, and it can cause people to focus inward and avoid dealing with day to day life. It can cause grievers to be left alone in their grief by friends and a community that doesn't know how to deal with loss. Being part of our community, a place where people are safe to explore their feelings no matter what, a place where we can share anger, confusion, sadness, hopelessness, guilt and not be judged is a powerful thing. Having someone there to say, \"Me too, I've felt that way\" can really make a huge difference in our lives. Once you know you aren't alone, that there are hundreds of people out there who have felt your pain and have survived-- not only survived but lived again after loss--can be an incredibly healing realization. Here are some ways that support groups have helped to turn grief into action: People build new friendships. They advocate for change in their own towns. They work to change laws. They gather together in prevention activities. They support the newest members of the group. They find their voice again. I'm so glad the people who led the path before me gave me my voice, and that I have played some small part to help others find theirs. Val: Robyn, you have been so generous with your passion and wisdom. Thanks so very much for all you have done. Robyn: Thank you for giving me this opportunity to talk with the Health Story Collaborative.

    "data": "By Audrey Stern I am sitting at a small table across from Ralph, a 92-year-old resident at Newbridge on the Charles assisted living facility in Dedham, MA. After hearing about the Elderwise Project, he graciously volunteered to be interviewed and welcomed me into his apartment. His is my first interview and I feel nervous about how the process will unfold. I fumble with the microphone and tape recorder, double-checking that they are working. Although I come prepared with a long list of questions to spark conversation about his life and experience with aging, my thoughts turn to the enormous task of eliciting meaningful stories and wisdom in less than an hour. How will I know what is most important to ask about? Will Ralph feel comfortable sharing personal information with a stranger? I begin by asking Ralph what brought him to assisted living. As Ralph takes me back in time, from retiring on the Cape after a successful teaching career to being a caregiver for a friend with Parkinson's Disease, I am drawn in to his stories. With each subsequent resident interview, I am increasingly able to set aside the scripted questions and let my genuine interest guide the dialogue. Most of what I have to do is be present and listen. Elderwise, a pilot project on aging, was launched by Health Story Collaborative (HSC), a growing non-profit organization founded on the belief that storytelling promotes health. Established by Dr. Annie Brewster, an internal medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, HSC is grounded in scientific research that supports the health benefits of narrative, not only for individuals telling their stories but for listeners as well. Since its inception in 2013, HSC has provided various platforms for individuals to share their experience navigating illness, with the hope that shared stories can be psychologically healing and provide valuable lessons to other people and families facing health challenges. With Elderwise, the focus is on aging rather than illness. However, in the same spirit of HSC, the goal is to provide participants with a sense of purpose, a feeling of connection, and a chance to be heard. Ralph and the other five contributors to Elderwise, interviewed in 2019, all reside in the assisted living facility at Newbridge, a predominantly Jewish, well-educated community. Beyond those similarities, though, they come from diverse backgrounds. With an age range of 76 to 96 years, they have lived through myriad triumphs and tribulations, which gives them a perspective that most younger people do not have. They not only have familiarity with aging but also knowledge about how to survive difficult times. Just as their life journeys have been unique so too has their experience with growing older. Some residents referred to the positives of this phase of life, such as living closer to family and having time to explore hobbies and learn new skills. That said, none were immune to the difficulties of getting older. They each faced stressors in one form or another, such as illness, reduced mobility, and loss of loved ones. Several participants reported that, although they appreciated the care, transitioning to assisted living was an adjustment. They missed the freedom to come and go on their own schedule and the close friendships they had in the past. Some residents alluded to feeling lonely at times. By and large, though, they were coping with the challenges of this stage of life and adapting well. The residents' resiliency can be traced to their ability to draw upon lessons learned from earlier events in their lives. For example, growing up as an only child prepared Leonora for living alone. Although she envies people with siblings, she believes it is important to make the best of your situation, do what you can do, and not dwell on what you can't control. She is not able to walk well anymore, but she is able to keep up with her quilting. Having faced discrimination, Saundra is not afraid to speak up for herself and others. And Evelyn, who never married, emphasizes the value of good friends. As a lifelong traveler, she credits the high points of her life to a willingness to take chances and try new things. I walked away from each interview surprised by how enriching it was. As much as I understood the value of listening to people's stories, I had not anticipated the extent to which their advice would speak to me. I had volunteered for Elderwise to do good for others, hoping to be a supportive presence and make a small dent in combatting the loneliness that can occur in assisted living facilities. Yet at the completion of the project, I felt as if I had gained the most. Now more than ever, I am grateful for having had the opportunity to meet these six individuals and listen to their rich insights. As COVID-19 has hit older people particularly hard, visitors are no longer allowed. Moreover, like many nursing homes and assisted living residences, the Newbridge community has tragically lost some residents to the virus, including Bunny, a 96-year-old woman who sat with me to share her stories for this project. Despite chronic health impairments, she welcomed the opportunity to help out. In doing so, she left behind a moving reflection on her life and a lasting legacy for her family. After more than nine weeks of quarantine, the residents at Newbridge are still confined to their apartments. Meals and mail are disinfected and delivered to their doors. Programming is broadcast through a cable channel. It is a lonely time with no known end point. I cannot help but worry about how they are holding up. Recently, I picked up the phone and called Ralph. We hadn't spoken in more than four months when I visited with photographer, Jennifer Jordan, who took pictures of the residents for the project. Coronavirus wasn't a known threat back then, not in the U.S. at least. I asked him if he remembered who I was. Of course, he said with a warm laugh. He explained that his days were long and mundane, filled with a lot of television. Occasionally, he met up with a resident for a social-distance chat outside. There were other catastrophic diseases he had witnessed in his lifetime, such as polio, but the effects of this virus might just be the worst. But then Ralph shared an optimistic message, reminiscent of advice he gave during his interview: \"Life has a way of turning around. Look how far we've come since mid-March. We will get through it.\" As our elders must isolate for their safety, the repercussions are felt deeply among all of us. Without social support and opportunities to contribute positively to their communities, older people may feel invisible or disposable. And we lose too. We miss out on learning from their stories and wisdom. The mission of the Elderwise Project, to celebrate and honor the voices of older people, has never felt more important.

    "data": "Gastroparesis is an \"invisible disease\", which means that no one knows that I am sick by just looking at me. They make comments about how great I look after losing so much weight. They don't understand when I tell them thanks for the compliment, but I lost all of my weight from not being able to eat anything and would rather be heavier than feel the way I do. My Gastroparesis Story My name is Trisha and I am sharing my personal story to give you an inside look at what it's like living with this awful and misunderstood disease. I have had GI-related issues and numerous sporadic episodes of being unable to eat due to pain and nausea/vomiting for many years, but none of the episodes has been anywhere close to being as severe or long-lasting as the issue I have now. In early February of 2013, I became sick with what we thought was a common stomach bug. I was unable to eat or receive an adequate amount of fluids orally, due to severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. As I progressively got weaker and the symptoms increased, my doctor diagnosed me with possible diverticulitis. After a few trips to the ER, with little help and no real improvement, my family and I knew that this was not a stomach bug, so I decided to see a gastroenterologist for my issues. My gastroenterologist ran a number of imaging tests, but could not find anything that would be causing my inability to intake any nutrition without pain, nausea, lack of appetite, and vomiting. After a couple of months went by and I continued to get weaker and lose weight, I was referred to a urologist and a gynecologist. Neither could come up with a reasonable diagnosis to explain my symptoms. I was referred to a surgeon for a diagnostic laparoscopy. I never made it to that appointment because my husband had had enough of me going from doctor to doctor with no results. I was not improving. Months had passed, and I was still unable to eat, vomiting or dry-heaving when anything went in my mouth, and in lots of pain. So one morning, my husband drove me to UNC, where I was admitted for testing. I went home the following week on a liquids-only diet. I was unable to drink an adequate amount of fluids following hospital discharge and I became dehydrated. In addition, I was facing awful side effects from Reglan, the medication the doctors had put me on. I returned to UNC and was once again hospitalized. I had to receive nutrition, and it was clear that I would not be getting it orally. In May 2013, I had to resort to having a GJ feeding tube placed in my small intestine, which I still have today. I have a machine that pumps formula into my body for at least 15 hours a day. I have to wear a backpack carrying this formula all day. At first, it was hard to accept, but my faith helped me gain peace, and I became comfortable with wearing the bag in public. (I admit a more comfortable and stylish bag did help some as well.) I have continued to have rough days but have been able to function \"normally\" on most days. Nevertheless, the past 6 months have been extremely difficult for me physically and emotionally, as my body has begun having trouble with tolerating enough calories via the tube. Surviving on less than 500 calories a day doesn't give me much energy at all. I am a 5th grade Science/Social Studies teacher. I love teaching with a passion, and this year is my 15th year as an elementary teacher. However, due to illness and other hospitalizations, I have been unable to work. At first, I was angry and upset. I honestly thought that I was fulfilling my purpose by being a teacher and loving mother, so why was my body keeping me from being in the classroom? I questioned God's reasons for making me endure the pain and suffering of this debilitating disease. I honestly try my best to live my life with as much love, understanding, and patience as I can. With prayers and contemplation, I have come to believe there is another purpose for my life; at least I hope that's what it is. Some doctors have me diagnosed as having \"Gastroparesis\" which means a \"paralyzed stomach.\" I have learned that the majority of the public and even medical providers/physicians are not aware of this debilitating disease. Some doctors label me as having a \"Functional GI Motility Disorder.\" Regardless of the label, my life has drastically changed. Since my diagnosis, I have seen multiple doctors/nurses. I have had many return visits to the ER for dehydration, uncontrollable pain and nausea, and feeding tube issues. Every 3 months I have to return to Interventional Radiology and have my feeding tube replaced, sometimes even sooner if it clogs or falls out. I was an active parent, wife, daughter, and teacher before my illness. I was overweight, but otherwise healthy and felt great. Since getting sick, I have lost approximately 160 pounds, and on most days, especially recently, feel too awful to be active. My quality of life has diminished, but I will continue to fight to get it back. At first, I felt strong and brave, thinking I could live my life the same as always. I would just have a different way of receiving my nutrition. Instead of eating, I would tube feed. To begin with, I tried feeding at night so that I could feel and look \"normal\" during the day. But I was not \"normal\" anymore. I was struggling to get through my day at work, just to come home and crash with my family. I gave up trying to hide my illness, and decided to begin wearing my backpack during the day to run my feeds in hopes that my energy would improve. I wear my backpack all day, regardless of whether I am working, grocery shopping, or going to a doctor's visit. Although I love my teaching career, I am currently on medical leave because my body cannot keep up with my physical demands. I am praying to regain my strength and get my symptoms under control so I can return to teaching soon, as I miss it greatly. I was hospitalized this past October (2014) for almost 2 weeks because my body couldn't even handle the formula that I was trying to send through my GJ tube. In December (2014), I had my gallbladder removed, and since then, I have been trying to increase my feeds so I can function and regain my strength. I am currently surviving on less than 700 calories (tube fed) a day. I despise how this disease makes me feel guilty over missing family events and not being able to attend some of my children's activities. I hate not being able to easily go out to eat, to sporting events, camping, vacations, or any of the other things I enjoyed prior to my illness. I am young and should have lots of life ahead of me, but instead I am struggling to find a cure or treatment that can allow me to actively live again. It's hard to fathom that there is not a cure for gastroparesis/FGIMD and that I may have to deal with feeling like this for the remainder of my life. Gastroparesis is an \"invisible disease\", which means that no one knows that I am sick by just looking at me. They make comments about how great I look after losing so much weight. They don't understand when I tell them thanks for the compliment, but I lost all of my weight from not being able to eat anything and would rather be heavier than feel the way I do. I am angry at times. My insurance will not cover my formula that is required for me to survive and puts hurdles in my way before covering certain treatment options. Sometimes when I see a new doctor or nurse, I have to TEACH THEM what is wrong with me, what kind of medications I need that work, and which medications I have to stay away from. I am heartbroken when I make some exciting plans with the family, but then I have to cancel because of being sick. I want MY LIFE back! I have been blessed, though, with receiving help and support from those around me. I am fortunate to have found a wonderful gastroenterologist who actually listens, seems to genuinely care, and attempts to help me manage my symptoms. Additionally, I am appreciative of the support I receive from my ever-growing GP community. I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. I have faith. Through this storm, a wonderful bond was formed with two of my fellow GP warriors. We are using social media and our advocacy group to create web pages, community pages, Twitter movements, gastroparesis-related events, letter writing campaigns to elected officials, the media, and medical providers. We are writing and distributing petitions, making awareness videos, creating fundraisers, and participating in all sorts of other activities to support the GP community. We have formed a magnificent team. I have come to realize and accept that God has set forth this path for me. I HATE GASTROPARESIS! It has been a thorn in my side, but I am finding my way.",

    "data": "By Annabelle Hatsav As my phone fell to the ground, my body went with it. Everything went blurry and I couldn't even understand what was coming out of my mouth. A fire lit inside my chest. \"She's gone, I'm so sorry Annabelle.\" I don't believe it. I keep asking why, why, why? We were just texting a couple of weeks before this. We had plans, this was not meant to happen.God please tell me this isn't true.I kept touching the gravelly pavement beneath me to ground myself, to feel that this was all real. I faced dark green bushes trying not to fall forward or draw attention to myself.This is not real, this is not happening. She is not dead, she is not dead. I heard footsteps approaching me as my tears poured down my face like a faucet. \"Are you okay? Do you need some water or anything?\" A staff member asked me. \"No, I'm fine, thank you.\" I lied. Usually, I'm so good at pretending I'm fine, but I don't think I could have put on a more convincing act. One of my best friends texted me a message I never saw coming. \"I heard what happened to Ava*, I'm so sorry and I'm here for you if you need anything.\" I didn't want to assume the worst.Please don't tell me she died. Please don't tell me she killed herself. Please don't tell me she's not here anymore. Don't jump to conclusions.\"Ruby please tell me it's not true, what did that text mean?\" \"I'm so sorry Annabelle, Ava killed herself two weeks ago.\" The worst was true. My body was on fire as I started hyperventilating and sobbing in the driveway of my camp.Feel the ground, feel that you are real.I couldn't breathe. I couldn't do anything but cry. Questions were popping into my head as I sat there.How long was she feeling that way? Should I have reached out more? Should I have made more of an effort? Somehow it felt like my fault. When people talk about suicide loss they often talk about survivor's guilt. It's not the feeling that it should have been you, it's the feeling that you could have done more to help. That it's your fault until proven that it's not. Every interaction I had with Ava was rushing through my head and I was feeling the survivor's guilt heavily. I told my mom about it and she didn't know what to say. I told my brother Matan about it and he was speechless. I told my therapist, and she assured me, it was not my fault.How could I believe her?The feelings pounded through my body every time I thought about her, which was every day for weeks. I didn't know what to do with myself, but I knew that I couldn't be alone. All my friends were in a meeting on the other side of the camp, which I was late for. There was no way in hell I would go to that meeting. But I headed there anyway. I dragged my feet through the freshly cut grass passing by a gathering of staff members.Don't look at me.I couldn't stop the tears, I knew I would eventually get dehydrated then my body would really start shutting down. One of my campers walked past me and saw my red puffy face so she asked if I was okay. I gave the classic answer: \"Yes I'm fine, don't worry about me.\" And continued on my track to find a friend, anyone really. My friend Adam was playing basketball when I saw him. I knew he would come running to support me. He wrapped his arms around me and said, \"Where do you want to go?\" We headed into the woods to a dock overlooking a lake, a beautiful place where a lot of counselors would come to think. On the way there he held me as I was shaking and couldn't stop. We hobbled so much shit in our path. He tried to make me laugh, I did, but I couldn't stop my mind from racing. I watched the water ripple as I talked in my shaky voice. My head started to hurt as the water left my eyes so willingly. Ava, my friend from middle school and high school, was two years younger than me. In middle school, we did crew backstage for the plays together. I was the stage manager and she was a perfect crew member. I was her mentor, I answered all of her questions and helped her with everything. I remember feeling so valued by her. She made me realize how much I could give to others, and how much she could give. Ava called me freckle. She said it was because I had six freckles (she counted), and I loved it. When I left to go to Paris for my freshman year of high school, she was worried we wouldn't keep in touch. She said she would miss me a lot, and I told her I would too. We kept in touch and when I came back, I was so excited to see her again, and I would always answer her questions. When she entered high school, I wanted to still be a good influence and mentor, but also her cool older friend at the same time. I tried my best and always made time for her, then I graduated. I felt that I didn't keep in touch enough after I graduated. I felt guilty for not texting her as much. We texted once in a while, and I always kept up with her on social media. But it wasn't the same. A month before I left for camp, she texted me saying she was going to Wheaton College in the fall and that we should hang out. I suggested we hang out in New York before the fall because I missed her. She said she missed me too. I will always miss her. Those texts ran through my mind for the next few weeks. I thought about how I could have asked her how she was feeling, we could have called. I should have done more, I should have asked more questions...I should have connected with her more. All the what-ifs were circling my brain and making me spin into a guilty state of mind. I had to remember, this wasnot my fault. How could I have known she was depressed? I didn't bottle it up this time, but I did keep it from my friends for a week. Being at camp and receiving this news was so conflicting because of the high-stress environment where I had to be responsible with a positive face on all the time. I couldn't afford to mourn. It was like I was floating above my body and observing what was going on below. The camp counselor in me wanted to keep it together so badly, but I had my moments. Thank God my co-counselor was one of my best friends and understood that I needed time for myself. But I didn't tell my other friends until they asked me what was going on. It was the worst, yet the best place to be to mourn. I knew I had so much love and support around me, but I just couldn't ask for it. I wrote in my journal after Ava died. I wrote letters to her asking her why she did it, begging her to forgive me. For what? I'm not sure. I messaged her on Instagram telling her I missed her. I spoke to her ghost trying to find some peace. I found out the funeral was recorded on YouTube, I never watched it, I'm not sure that I ever will. Why'd you do it?I asked her over and over again in my moments of being alone.Please tell me why. Send me a sign. Anything. Thinking about Ava made me think about how happy she was with me. She left my high school after I graduated to go to a different school. I wonder if that's when she started having suicidal thoughts. Or maybe it happened before that. It's so incredibly hard thinking about all the things she's going to miss out on. Fuck my school for not doing enough. I had to direct my anger somewhere, so I chose my high school instead of myself. I found out about the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in 10th grade and how they host walks to raise money for suicide prevention all over the country each year. I loved the idea of seeing people who had similar experiences and feeling a sense of community, rather than feeling alone. The first year I went on the walk it was beautiful, I cried the whole time around hundreds of people wearing t-shirts with family members that died on them and crying with their friend's arm in arm. I have participated every year since, and I never plan to stop. Ava made me want to fight even more for the discussion on mental health, and how anyone can prevent suicide. I will never be the same. I call into question my own actions to my friends.Am I being a good friend?Thinking about each time I hear the news it never gets easier. My body catches on fire each time and I gasp for air reaching for something that slipped away moments before. I remind myself each day how lucky I am to have the support I need, and how I wish Ava had the support she needed. I can't turn back time. I can go back to the moment of me sitting on the pavement in disbelief that she was no longer on this Earth. I will miss her every day. I will never stop fighting for suicide prevention because it's a part of me, my story, and so many others too. Rest In Peace, Ava. *A pseudonym was used to protect the privacy of the family.

    "data": "Hello, my name is Annalisa and this is the story of my mother's battle with ovarian cancer as seen through my eyes, her only daughter and one of her primary caregivers. So, I guess you can say this is really alsomystory, in which my dear friend Rhaea Photopoulos, an amazing nurse practitioner here at MGH, is a very important character. My mother Carol was born in 1938 in Lynn, Massachusetts to Polish and Lithuanian parents. My grandmother worked in the shoe tanneries and my grandfather was a career machinist at General Electric. My mom was a bright, only-child and a latchkey kid who spent her time playing outside, reading, or at the movies. By the 1970s my mom was a happily married, stay-at-home mother to me and my younger brother. My dad was in the grocery business and we lived a modest, middle-class lifestyle. It's fair to say that when it came to medical issues, Carol was 'old-school.' Not to say that she was anti-Western medicine. Definitely not. It's just that she was never one to run to the doctors with us unless there was something obviously wrong like a broken bone. She was what we might call, an under-reactor. When my brother and I became teenagers, I swear my dad did the worrying for the two of them. My mom was a strong Catholic and would always say she was putting something in 'god's hands' and not expending valuable energy worrying, because worrying wasn't going to change the situation. Growing up I was ambitious, hard-working and a self-starter who my mother always said was going to be successful no matter what. I became self-reliant almost to a fault - always in motion, constantly doing, doing, doing. I was babysitting and doing my own laundry by age 11 (remember, this was the early 80s - kids could do all that stuff back then!); worked a 'real' job at the hospital by 15; ran 11 seasons of HS track. I earned myself a scholarship to Boston College -and thank goodness -because my mom made it clear that she wasn't about to mortage the house for me to attend college! Carol didn't mince words! Boston College is where I met my longtime friend Rhaea. We met at the workout center known as The Plex, and became fast friends. Rhaea is the angel in this story, as you will learn. My mom was widowed in 2010 at age 72. The first few years were very difficult, but at last in July 2015 she decided to take a religious pilgrimage to France where she would bathe in holy water and pray for her long list of friends who needed her prayers. Little did she know, but by the time she was bathing in that holy water, ovarian cancer was actively growing inside of her. After the pilgrimage, my mom followed up on a belly button infection from many weeks prior and learned that the biopsy result came back positive for cancer. The next stop was the gynecologist where we learned that my mom had a tumor on her ovary, and it appeared that the cancer had spread. She would need surgery ASAP. We were both stunned. One of my first calls was to Rhaea. A caring, compassionate, palliative care nurse specialist at MGH, Rhaea was well-connected and knowledgeable. Plus, she and I had been friends for 25 years at this point so she knew my mom well. Mom and Rhaea had really bonded through their common faith and Polish heritage. Rhaea and I have been through thick and thin together, always showing up when it counted. After BC, we lived together for a couple of years during graduate school, and without Rhaea to watch out for me I don't think I would've eaten one single thing besides pasta with broccoli and fake Parmesan cheese (the kind that doesn't need to be refrigerated)! Rhaea would always run out to Bread and Circus and get me some chicken to throw in there - just to make sure I had protein!Giving and caringare just in Rhaea's nature. With Rhaea's help, we ended up in the office of a top-notch gynecologic oncologist and surgeon at MGH who held my mom's hand and listened intently as Carol told her that she felt confident that everything was going to be OK. My mom also told the doctor \"she's in charge\" (and pointed to me). \"You can deliver all the bad news to Annalisa.\" She then thanked the doctor and in true Carol form told her that she was in her God Box. I accepted the role of 'receiver-of-all-bad-news' and the one who is 'in charge' as a given; I wasn'tupsetabout the added pressure, but reflecting back on the experience I realize that itwasa lot of pressure. I thought that since my dad couldn't be here, I would be the best substitute that I could. And- I had my angel Rhaea by my side. The day of the surgery was the day before my birthday, August 21st, 2015. I stayed with my mom until they needed to wheel her down for anesthesia. I remember clearly that she had plastic rosary beads entwined around her hands, because she was told that she could take the plastic beads into surgery but not the metal beads. After she prayed over her medical team, she and I said our goodbyes and exchanged 'I love you's' When the doctor called, she seemed to suggest that the surgery had been a great success, but in the same sentence she said something about my mother \"possibly\" having a \"decent quality of life\" for 2-3 years. 2-3 years. Stage 4 ovarian cancer. I was in a fog and I felt that the doctor and I were speaking two completely different languages, so I didn't fully absorb the conversation in the moment-it wasn't until after we hung up the phone that it started to sink in. I decided to Google 'ovarian cancer'. What I found was that Stage 4 ovarian cancer statistics were not exactly something to be excited about. Living another 5 years seemed quite possible, but another 10 years, well, you'd REALLY have to be one of the lucky ones. I felt a little numb and discouraged. And then I called Rhaea. Calm, rational, and optimistic, Rhaea assured me that every case of cancer is completely individual and that in her experience patients with deep and abiding faith like my mom generally fare quite well. I felt a lot better, and promised Rhaea that I wouldn't Google medical stuff anymore. Fast forward to the beginning of Covid in April 2020, four years after diagnosis. My mom's appetite and energy level were diminishing. She mustered up the energy to come to our house for Easter, but sadly that day she would have her last (small) glass of Chateauneuf du Pape wine. Kind of appropriate, I suppose, being the wine of the Popes and all. Not long after Easter, I found her in such a weakened state that we went to the cancer center to get checked, marking the first time I had to drop her off with no option to stay, due to Covid. After reminding her to put on her mask, I somewhat reluctantly let the nurse at the front door escort her in. I flashed a half-hearted, nervous smile, thanked the nurse, got in my car, and drove away. After a short-term boost from hydration treatment, my mom was right back in the same place: light-headed, no appetite, congested, heart racing, mildly confused. When I brought Rhaea up to speed, she said we needed to get her admitted ASAP. ....... My mom acquiesced, though on the ride in she was very agitated. Her bags were incredibly disorganized and she was pretty sure she had forgotten something - a special religious medal that her priest had blessed especially for her - that was super, super important to her and we had to go back for it. I still needed to get gas and didn't want to be late, but I turned back, none too happy. I was impatient, and stressed, and I yelled something like 'we better not be late because of this!! And 'it better be at the house if I turn back!' We arrived on time and there was Rhaea, waiting out front with a wheelchair. I breathed a sigh of momentary relief at the sight of her. The next 2 days in the hospital would be a turning point in the journey: the chemotherapy had ceased to be effective and the recommendation was to stop treatment and focus on preserving quality of life. Rhaea cross -checked recommendations and simplified medical terms for me. End of life intentions came up again, and here is what I knew of with certainty - my mom's 3 final wishes: 1) remain in our family home; 2) have a funeral mass; and 3) live to her 82nd birthday on July 3rd. Making it to her birthday was a wish that virtually everyone knew about. She and my dad were nearly exactly 10 years apart and my dad died at age 82. For some reason or other she felt that she would be reunited with him after having spent the same number of years alive as he had. Shortly after she came home from the hospital Rhaea came over to see her in person and to survey the conditions at the house. When I walked her out to her car, she said, 'She looks good. You're doing the right thing, AL' (her nickname for me). You're doing an amazing job. I am here for you every step of the way. She won't suffer. IPROMISE.\"This reassurance gave me a mini-boost. I went straight home and told my husband what she said. The final 8 weeks of my mom's life would find me in survival mode with you name it, from my daughter's remote schooling, to daily drugstore runs and new medications, to everyone's laundry, to endless phone calls to coordinate visits or equipment deliveries, to worrying about Carol falling out of bed, and so on. I literally felt as though I was moving in and out of two different lives every time I got up in the morning. Ihadto get out there every day, get to the drugstore, interact with people. I tried to put the Covid risks out of my mind. During this stretch Rhaea made a ritual of driving an hour + every Friday to visit with me and Carol. She would bring her daughter and our girls would ride bikes in my old neighborhood while we'd sit outside with Carol and chat. On one of the visits I remember Rhaea opened her trunk and out came potting soil, plants, garden tools and even a shovel! I'm like WHAT are you doing???? Rhaea started digging up the soil under the front windows, right next to the porch where my mom would always sit. She said 'People are going to be stopping by to see you Carol, we have to make this look nice. AL, where's the HOSE???' Another week, Rhaea showed up with some type of Polish food, hoping my mom would eat even just a little. July 3rd arrived and mom was weak. We barely got her to a chair on the porch. Before we knew it about 50 masked friends and neighbors were gathered alongside the fence. My goddaughter had painted a huge banner that we hung across the front windows and I had managed to keep a few of Rhaea's spring flowers alive so Carol was literally surrounded by life and love. She was so happy. She had her 2 children and 3 grandchildren by her side plus neighbors and friends of some 40+ years. Some people wanted - even tried! - to come in the gate because they wanted to be close to my mother so badly. My husband did the uncomfortable job of reminding everyone that we were supposed to be social distancing! One week after her birthday, the hospital bed was delivered. Another Rhaea intervention. It was time, in fact it was past due. Mom had been sleeping in the recliner for several weeks, and she had fallen at least twice that I knew about. The bed was in the front TV room where she spent all of her time, in that recliner watching Mass on TV. She would live only 5 nights in that hospital bed, with my brother and me alternating sleeping there. Rhaea had suggested a night nurse, but I knew my mother wouldn't want this. I was in a robotic-like state these last several days, attending to details, wondering, worrying, when and how the end would look. My mom's voice was quickly fading away but for about 2 days she could still whisper a few words with her eyes wide open - this in between increasing periods of sleep. Rhaea had told me a while back in one of herprep-talks, 'she's going to sleep a lot more but please don't worry, she will be peaceful. The first couple of months after my mom's funeral were both sad and strange. Strange because I had this intense feeling of peacefulness come over me that I had neither expected nor experienced before. I felt an odd sense of relief that I was shy to share with almost anyone outside of my husband and of course, Rhaea. I felt light on my feet, free from an underlying feeling of WORRY that I didn't even know was there almost constantly for 5 years. Rhaea and I talked or texted every day or two in those final weeks of the Summer of 2020. The dreaded cleanout of my family home was ahead - a home that wasliterallypacked basement to attic with memorabilia dating back over 100 years. The task was daunting but on that very first weekend, my angel showed up. In Rhaea fashion, she was quick and decisive and she istotally hilarious,like a sweet wrecking ball when it comes to this stuff. She had my brother and me laughing so much that afternoon. I tried to laugh - you really had to - at all of the crazy clothes and jewelry andstuffthat my mom had saved. Within a few hours Rhaea's SUV waspackedwith all of my mother's winter coats that she was taking to a women's shelter on the Cape. As she drove away that day, she assured me that she'd be back again. And I knew that she would. After three decades of friendship Rhaea and I were spiritually connected already, but now it is a much deeper connection, one that I believe is unbreakable and everlasting. I am inaweof Rhaea's endless space for loving and caring, inspired by the depth of her knowledge and the empathy with which she executes the tasks involved with caregiving. She makes it all look so effortless. And she does it with a fantastic sense of humor! She reminds me that while life IS serious, we cannot take ourselves too seriously. Throughout this journey, Rhaea propped me up when I felt as though I was falling, encouraged me when I was daunted by the endless unknowns of caring for my mother through the Covid crisis. The deepening of our friendship after this five-year journey cannot be understated. SHE is the reason, I believe in my heart, that I was able to execute on my mother's final wishes, and no one can ever take that away. Carol was able to die at home, in the home that my dad built for her and where he also passed away, free from tubes and extraordinary measures. Rhaea was by my side during an experience that has changed my life forever, and I am filled with gratitude. Rhaea - I know you are in Carol's God Box up in heaven, and you are surely in mine.",

    "data": "Sculptor Dennis@DennisSvoronos.com DennisSvoronos.com In September of 2009--at 26 years of age--I was diagnosed with cancer, after experiencing the first of many seizures to come. Of all the trials I could imagine that lay ahead, I never thought most of them would be exercises in recollection. Patient name? Dennis Svoronos (thankfully I can always get this one) Date of birth? 3/8/83 (a palindrome, helps to keep it easy) Occupation? Artist (maybe not my parents first choice) Approximate date of last surgery? 11/09 (Who forgets their first brain surgery) Existing medical conditions? Anaplastic Astrocytoma (a cancerous brain tumor) Repeat daily, for years. As time progressed; I remember those waiting rooms, questions and ID tags much more than the operating theatre and injections; trauma is kind like that. However, they made me feel intrinsically linked to my disease. What was I, without these suffixes of sickness to identify with? Somehow, all my other unique and admirable qualities were set-aside for the identifier of 'cancer patient'. It's easy to resign to the belief that those forms and wristbands define your life, mere statistics, data--you and your cancer. Just as painless, is to ignore the process completely, pretending your exams and operations are the bad dreams of another person, your 'real life' goes on unaffected. Either way, it seems you're not to talk openly about cancer, and it is difficult for most; patients, family and doctors alike. My initial sense was, it would be easier for me--and more comfortable for others--to keep off the topic. Sickness is a surprisingly taboo subject in a very liberal culture. The artist in me, however, couldn't stop questioning why we hide from the discussion. Over the course of my treatment and the years to follow, the entirety of my work became a continuous, very uncomfortable, conversation about my disease with anyone that would listen. In doing so, I freed myself from the fear and shame that I felt initially upon my diagnosis. It allowed me to speak honestly to an audience on an issue I was passionate about, to relate to others on a level beyond the initial stigma of sickness. I became a proud patient. My work wasn't about the 'battle', 'fight' or being a 'survivor'; the words of conflict I was trying to avoid. The art became focused on the subtle, sincere and even sarcastic aspects of the life-changing experience I was going through. I wasn't interested in discussing my struggle with cancer; I wanted to embrace the insight it gave me. In January of 2014, I exhibited a solo show of this work at the Boston Sculptors Gallery (486 Harrison Ave. Boston). In the month that followed, I was able to engage with patients and the public in ways I was never able to before. My show became a safe space for anyone to talk about this difficult subject. In doing so, stories were shared, wisdom was gained and many tears--of joy and woe--were shed. To all who came, I sought to impart a sense of community and empathy they didn't enter with. I learned, as a patient I need to speak about my experience with the 'healthy' world, regardless of stigma or discrimination. My ultimate healing came through delightful conversations about a horrible problem. Dennis Svoronos: Biography Dennis Svoronos' work exists between art and engineering; it is inspired by the modern world in motion. He uses his sculpture to reflect this environment charged with electricity, spectacle and information. He uses our common language of the 21st century: electronics, robotics and interactive kinetics, to build connections between the viewers and the work. In a society fractured by technology, Dennis Svoronos uses it to bring us together. At current, he is making work in response to his recent diagnosis of brain cancer, seeking to use his art as a platform to question sickness, wellness and recovery. Dennis Svoronos is a Boston-based sculptor whose work has been shown nationally and internationally. He holds a diploma from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and a Bachelors of Fine Arts from Tufts University. His work has been exhibited at numerous institutions and galleries such as the MFA, Boston; the Norton Museum of Art, Palm Beach, FL; G.A.S.P Brookline, MA; and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Lake Worth, FL. Svoronos has also been the recipient of numerous awards and public work commissions. Currently, he is living and working in South Boston.",

    "data": "This is a story about the value of writing and how it sustained me throughout my treatment for an aggressive cancer. In 2016, my annual physical exam detected low white blood cell counts. My doctor referred me to a hematologist who recommended a bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy discovered acute myeloid leukemia and triggered immediate hospitalization. In forty-eight hours, I went from feeling fine to intensive treatment for a lethal disease. The same day I began chemotherapy my wife was admitted to my hospital with a fractured femur. After preparing for and recovering from surgery, she transferred to a transitional care unit for a month-long rehabilitation. Meanwhile, I had a five-week hospital stay to treat infections arising from chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression. I proceeded through induction chemotherapy, consolidation chemotherapy, and a successful cord blood transplant. I'm now over three years out from my initial diagnosis and final treatment, and I remain cancer-free. While doctors treated my body, several strategies sustained my identity. Although I was retiring from my role as a professional sociologist, my identity as a writer making sense of my social and personal worlds was crucial throughout my odyssey. My identity-sustaining strategies included mindfulness practices, physical activity, a pro-active attitude to my illness, unrelenting humor, and a secular worldview. But my most valuable strategy was writing my story. It started simply enough during my first week of hospitalization when I realized we needed a way to keep folks informed about our situation. People suggested a Caring Bridge site with updates for all to see. However, announcing to the world that our home would be unoccupied for a month or more seemed unwise. Instead, I sent an email to neighbors asking them to collect our mail and keep an eye on our house. I quickly realized that emails were an efficient way to keep everyone informed. I eventually sent over sixty reports to more than fifty recipients. These missives combined medical updates and progress reports with reflections on being a cancer patient and the often mysterious and frightening world of cancer care. These reports were composed for a known audience. I was highly conscious that I was writing for others and included some humor to lighten the impact of my otherwise dire news. One of the great benefits of writing for others was the supportive feedback I received from my correspondents. It eventually dawned on me that these cumulative reports had become a kind of cancer memoir. On a more profound level, it also occurred to me that I was writing for and to myself. Each day in the hospital brought a new, dizzying array of personnel, medications, tests, scans, side-effects, cautions, and complications. While I received excellent care, it was an overwhelming initiation into the world of cancer treatment that left me feeling highly vulnerable and utterly dependent on the care of strangers. The best way I could make sense of it was to write about it. Writing became my therapy. It allowed me to take the chaotic threads of my daily experience and weave them into a coherent narrative of what was happening tome. My writing translated swirling emotions and unpredictable circumstances into a narrative that tamed my fears and preserved my identity. At a time when there wasn't much I could control, telling my story made me the author of my own life. In short, writing became a psychic survival mechanism. Late in the process, I decided to share my story more broadly. With the addition of a preface on lessons learned and an epilogue on identity changes, my memoir appeared from Written Dreams Publishing in December 2018. As I was preparing my book for publication, I read the Canadian sociologist Arthur Frank's book onThe Wounded Storyteller.His work retrospectively overlaid a whole new level of insight into my narrative and how patients can retain their personhood in the face of life-threatening illness and technically driven treatment. Frank claims that storytelling by ill persons can play a crucial role in shifting them from a passive to an active role in their illness. While doctors may ensure our survival, telling ourstory can maintain our identity. Put differently, while people surrender their bodies to medicine, they retain their self by telling their story. Storytelling thereby rescues patients from the medical colonization that would otherwise reduce them to passive patients in an asymmetrical powerrelationship. Frank describes three types of stories that emerge out of illness. The first, restitution narratives, say \"I was healthy, then I was sick, now I am (becoming) healthy again.\" Here, the patient's body is analogous to a broken-down car, the physician is an able mechanic, and the patient is a passive bystander drinking bad coffee in theshop's waiting room. Patients eventually get better in a restitution story, but it remains one in which an active physician restores the sick body of a passive self. Restitution stories are the medically and culturally approved way we think about illness: when something is broken, we get it fixed and move on.They nonetheless leave something important out of the picture as the person is reduced to a body needing repairs and the self is sidelined by the doctor's expertise. The coherence of restitution stories is lacking in the second type of narrative: chaos stories. Without narrative order, coherent sequence, or discernible causality, they carry no expectation of recovery or illusion of control. These stories are threatening to the patient, but also to physicians because they are an implicit critique of their limited ability to fix things. By their nature, chaos stories cannot be told as much as simply experienced by ill persons as overwhelming. They can overtake any sense of a coherent self and an orderly world for a patient. Despite the patient's sense of helplessness and the physician's dislike for such stories, they must be acknowledged before the patient can reclaim their personhood. The final type, quest stories, are the only ones in which the teller assumes center stage. Here, the patient accepts their illness and uses it to try to gain insight from their experience. Such stories involve a recursive journey; the patient takes a trip in order to discover what kind of trip it is, and then finds meaning that can be passed on to others. There is heroism in quest stories; it isn't the physician vanquishing disease but rather the patient persevering through suffering. As people become wounded storytellers, they derive meaning from telling their illness. Through quest stories, people become not just survivors but witnesses with a responsibility to share their stories. As I digested Frank's ideas, I realized I had become a wounded storyteller and that all three types of storytelling had appeared in my own accounts. My odyssey began as a chaos story. Upon my hospital admission, I had no clear understanding or sense of control over what was happening to me or my spouse. But wait, there's more: three weeks into our mutual incapacitation, a nasty storm brought down two sixty-foot trees onto the roof, deck, and gutters of our unoccupied home. It just seemed like anything could (and did) happen. My fractured impressions nicely fit Frank's description of chaos stories as proceeding through multiple, destabilizing events linked only by the phrase \"and then\" repeated over and over. Shortly thereafter, my reports changed as I learned more about my disease, my short-term treatment, and the long-term options for further treatment. In effect, my doctors were telling me a restitution story about how I had been healthy, then became sick, and now will get better. While my doctors and treatment provided the data points for this story, I played an active role by narrating it. But in order to convey my experience to others, I had to comprehend it myself. My readers became the prod for my own self-understanding, as writing-for-others seamlessly became therapy-for-me and a means of maintaining a coherent self The next turn in my narrative occurred after my day 180 consultation. I was six months out from my transplant and had tapered off my anti-rejection medication and its unwelcome side-effects. That turning point sparked a qualitative shift in my mindset. For the first time, I was able to accept that I had weathered my treatments, that they had been successful, and that I was actually better. I then described my mood as serene euphoria, but it came with a powerful urge to reach out and share my story. I now see this period as the beginning of a quest story. As I have reached out through my memoir, support groups, peer counseling, speaking engagements, writing workshops, fund-raising events, and survivorship conferences, I have met the responsibility to share my story and forge new connections with other members of the cancer community. My most meaningful, current activity is being a peer volunteer meeting with current transplant patients. Our common bond of transplant fosters profoundly personal conversations between complete strangers as we share our stories. In so doing, we broaden the circle of people who become authors of their own lives and join the community of wounded storytellers. Steve Buechleris a retired sociologist.

    "data": "Annie Robinson, a Health Story Collaborative team member and a recent graduate of Columbia University's Narrative Medicine program, curates the podcast \"Inside Stories\", a forum for medical students to share their stories of medical training. Read about this project here: On a warm June afternoon, clustered around picnic tables, cradled in the mountains of the Berkshires in western Massachusetts, eight medical students from around the world began telling one another their stories. They were among approximately 40 students invited to participate in a weeklong intensive program run by AMSA for medical students interested in integrative medicine called LEAPS. As a graduate studentof Narrative Medicine at Columbia University, I was asked to help facilitate the program. Over iced tea and dark chocolate, they spoke of heartbreak and grief and divorce, of exam-stress and isolation and fear. They also shared brilliant visions of innovative approaches to medical care, and their aspirations to foster intimate relationships with their fellow medical students, their families and friends, and their patients. I listened with rapt attention as they described how, from personal struggles, conviction and vision were born for their careers as caregivers. I shivered, on that muggy summer day, knowing I was in the presence of my tribe. I was raised to revere the power of storytelling, which has been a critical component in how I have navigated my way through the world. It proved particularly useful when I entered the healthcare system in my early adolescence. I have spent over half of my life now as a patient, grappling with illnesses and issues of embodiment. In large part, it has been by speaking my struggles aloud that I have been able to heal. Telling my stories has allowed me to harness the power of the dark times to create connections and attain insight. As I sat there at LEAPS, witnessing medical students experiencing what I myself had experienced time and again-that relationships and wisdom come from baring one's soul - I began to envision a way to enable more students to engage in this powerful narrative process. The seeds for my oral narratives podcast projectInside Stories: Medical Student Experienceswere planted. I wanted to hear more student stories about the path to medicine, about struggles and triumphs, roadblocks and dreams. Through sharing over the course of that week, the students gained clarity and catharsis, and many remain in touch to this day. Inside Storiesemerged from those conversations with LEAPS students. The idea was to develop a podcast platform that would enable medical students anywhere to both voice and listen to stories about medical student experience.Inside Stories'mission is \"to provide a means of personal healing, self-realization and empowerment through the sharing and receiving of personal stories, as well as to cultivate community among students in the often isolating medical school environment.\" The interview process involves recording stories from current medical students, remotely or in-person. Recruitment has been done via word-of-mouth, social media platforms, and at medical humanities conferences. Student participants comprise a diverse demographic of men and women from all four years of medical school, of various races and nationalities, interested in medical fields ranging from OB/GYN to pediatrics to gastroenterology and many more. The topics addressed are vast. Hannah spoke about the challenges of navigating in medical school while being a mother. Petra reflected on how her spiritual path informs the challenges being a medical student. Katie discussed the encouragement she gained from finding her mentor. Leah shared how writing poetry aided her personal healing. Samar described how self-care practices helped her get through school. Angie talked about how her Syrian heritage drove her motivation to become a physician. Hieu shared his experiences as a community health worker in Uganda propelled his motivation to combat structural violence. Carlton described his motivation to pursue medicine in the South: to offer the African-American community a provider with whom they can identify. To date, over 40 students have participated in the project. One participant reflected: \"At first I was intimidated at the prospect of sharing my deepest feelings to a public audience, especially because I had never verbalized these feelings and in general I am a very private person. Ultimately, I'm glad I committed myself to this project and am proud to have my message out in the open.\" Another described how sharing felt validating: \"It made it seem real - everything that I had been through.\" I hope that by listening to the accounts of the courageous, insightful students whose stories constitute this project, others will follow suit and be inspired to share the personal stories at the heart of their journeys through the world of medicine.

    "data": "I have experienced the powerful effect stories have in healing as both a patient and as a caregiver in the role of a full-spectrum doula, which involves supporting women through abortion, miscarriage, and fetal loss. As a graduate of the Narrative Medicine master's program at Columbia University, my driving mission in life is to elicit, honor, and attend to stories. I am the Assistant Director of theCenter for Narrative Practice, which provides people with deep critical training in how stories work and trains them to apply this knowledge to everyday life by using narrative practice, creative arts, and the study of story. I also curate an oral narrative project called \"Inside Stories: Medical Student Experiences\", for which I interview medical students about their experiences in medical school with the intention to provide a platform for their own person healing, self-realization and empowerment through the sharing and receiving of personal stories. I am honored to serve as Program Officer for Health Story Collaborative. As such, I conduct interviews, edit audio stories, and write a blog posts that profile remarkable individuals committed to honoring and making use of stories in health care. If you or someone you know might be interested in being interviewed, please contact me athealthstorycollaborative@gmail.com. For my first piece, I spoke with Dr. Sayantani DasGupta, a former professor of mine devoted to raising awareness in her students and in society about how to approach and honor illness narratives, and the intersections between narrative, health, and social justice. \"Stories are not the end goal, they're not a treasure we dig up, they're not a simple repository of facts, but rather, they're a process. And listening to them is an act of social justice.\" - Dr. Sayantani DasGupta Anyone who considers stories as central to healing swoons when listening to Dr. Sayantani DasGupta. I certainly did the first time I heard her speak, as my professor in an \"Illness Narratives\" class I took in Fall 2012 as a graduate student in Columbia University's Narrative Medicine program. Sayantani's passion for the power of story in medicine - which twinkles in her tone of voice and glitters in her eyes - is infectious. Sayantani trained in pediatrics and earned a Master of Public Health, and now devotes her time to being a professor, writer, speaker, feminist, and mother. One of the things that most excites Sayantani is thinking about how gender, race, class, and other social factors influence how we tell the stories of our bodies. In a recent conversation we had, she expressed concern that physicians tend to see stories as just \"nice\" instead of essential: \"Physicians sometimes think, 'Well, okay, that's nice, but is it really necessary?'\" \"Yes!\" she insists. Through their stories, patients become contextualized in the wider system to which they belong. As Sayantani puts it, patients \"are both a unique individual in this universe, and they are also not alone. They're situated in a family, in a culture, in a community, in a social system, in a political system, in a labor system.\" By listening to stories, physicians come to appreciate their patients as more than just parts and isolated disease carriers; they can see how the health of individuals is shaped by matters of social justice. And Sayantani believes that when physicians hear patients' stories, they are not only equipped to offer better care, but they are able to make major changes in healthcare: \"The greatest potential for narrative work in healthcare is the ability of renewed attention to story to illuminate structural injustices in medicine as a profession, and healthcare as a system.\" She advises physicians to consider how \"broader issues they're thinking about, like health access, continuity of care, accurate diagnosis of treatment, long-term follow-up, are connected to narrative. If we simply think of narrative as something that feels good and is nice...then we rob it of its real power.\" It's not only important that physicians listen to patients' stories, it's important how they listen. Sayantani believes that in order to provide the best healthcare, physicians must first engage in honest self-examination. They can ask themselves: \"What am I bringing to the table? What are my prejudices and expectations? What do I think about this person? Is it that they remind me of my Aunt Millie? Do I really hear their story well? Or do they frighten me and I don't hear their story well?\" She also encourages physicians to listen with a sense of their own limitations, something she calls \"narrative humility\" - that we can approach stories without the assumption that we're going to always necessarily \"get\" all of it: \"The folks we take care of are not necessarily going to be just like us - they are very likely not going to be like us - and their stories are not something that we can become necessarily competent about.\" A medical student Sayantani once taught who had Multiple Sclerosis wrote a beautiful piece about her experience that captures the essence ofnarrative humility. The student wrote: \"As a patient, I urge every doctor to try and place him or herself in the patient's shoes. Don't stand by the foot of the bed and power over your patient. She feels small already. Take a minute, sit down, listen.\" She then offered a small piece of advice to medical practitioners reading her essay: \"Try to understand. Realize that you will never understand. Try anyway.\" I shivered as Sayantani recounted these words, slowly and with reverence, and nodded in fervent agreement when she told me why she felt so moved by this simple but poignant piece: \"She's talking about the practicalities of how to listen, but also about the inequality inherent in one person being ill, vulnerable, naked, and frightened, and the other being full of knowledge. It really brings home the social justice role and the healing role of storytelling in our work. Yes, we try to put ourselves in our patient's shoes, but we have to be conscious of power. We also have to be conscious of what we bring to the table.\" The words echoed in our conversation, and still do in my heart: \"Try to understand. Realize that you will never understand. Try anyway.\" Sayantani DasGupta originally trained in pediatrics and public health at Johns Hopkins University, and now serves as a core faculty member of the Program in Narrative Medicine at Columbia University. She also teaches in the Health Advocacy program at Sarah Lawrence College. In addition to being a prolific writer, she is a nationally recognized speaker on issues of gender, race, storytelling, and medical education. At Columbia, one of the classes she teaches is a Narrative, Health and Social Justice seminar, and she co-chairs a faculty seminar of the same name.

    "data": "By Craig Norquist, MD I have to admit, my military background kicked into gear as soon as there was concern that this was a pandemic that we needed \"all hands on deck\" in order to be successful. As an ED doctor who has active non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, i was torn on wanting to work in the department as a provider and leader, thinking i could provide some sense of calm and leadership in the face of unknown. My 'other role' in healthcare is the CMIO (Chief Medical Information Officer) for our hospital network. We have 5 hospitals, one freestanding ED, and some 50 clinics that i oversee in regards to the EMR and all things digital. I have been working at least 12 hours per day behind the computer, in meetings, and one on ones to optimize the EMR to make it as helpful as possible. Early in the course of this it was helping to create and optimize alerting systems for those patients suspected of having the virus due to travel and symptoms. We also had to create order and resulting systems for testing and tie alerts to the results etc.. My time is hopefully productive in keeping the physicians protected from excessive clicking or documenting as well as optimizing their time on the computer. I have been scheduled to work a couple of shifts but have been called off due to low work load as our volumes are currently down due to the social (physical) distancing as well as people being afraid of coming to the hospital and getting infected. This makes my wife happy, but honestly it makes me feel as though I am 'hiding behind the computer.' I am reassured by my ED colleagues, other doctors in the system, as well as the IT personnel who I work with that my time spent as CMIO is invaluable to more people than if i was working a clinical shift. Someone in IT told me that \"there are lots of people who can be ED doctors, but far fewer who can be CMIO.\" I have to admit that did help me reconcile my guilt with the long hours i am putting in with informatics. It bothers me deeply that there are physicians and healthcare workers who are 'on the front lines' are sometimes putting themselves in a precarious position due to limited PPE. We are doing everything from trialing a video visit platform to minimize exposure time, to coordinating with our state health information exchange a way to get discrete data feeds of COVID test results as soon as a patient registers for a visit or in the ED. Each day brings new issues and hurdles, but it is exactly in times like these that we earn our trust and mettle amongst our colleagues. And on another, perhaps realistic but warped way to look at it, i might still be available as a second wave of providers that might be needed to care both the providers who become ill or the second surge of patients. Either way, I have never been more proud to be a physician and hope that we can continue to keep the wave of support and recognition going in order to regain the love and joy of caring for so many of the doctors who have lost it and become burned out.

    "data": "I am an artist based in the San Francisco Bay Area who specializes in the intersection of art and science. I focus on brain scans, particularly MRIs, because I consider them one of the primary symbols of Multiple Sclerosis. Since my diagnosis of MS, I have continually undergone brain scans to track the progression of my disease. Initially the sterile black and white images of the MRIs of my brain were terrifying, and I refused to look at them. I began using my art practice to reinterpret these frightening yet mesmerizing images. I seek to disrupt the unsightliness of these digital images, inviting the viewers to stare directly at the beauty and complexity of the imperfect brain. My diagnosis has allowed me to integrate neurotechnology into my artwork. Through printmaking, mixed media, and textiles I transform my scan into vibrant landscapes in hopes of challenging how society views illness. I create with the intent of transforming how people view the imperfect body, allowing room for celebration, curiosity, and fascination. My artwork has been displayed in permanent collection at various institutions, universities, and hospitals throughout the country. My heart remains rooted in the narrative of illness. I am now trying my hand at art and design in the clinical setting. I have been inspired by the power artwork can have to broaden and deepen the narrative around chronic illness. This is the core of my mission, to create artwork that encourages social engagement and spurs conversations. My vision for several upcoming projects combines patient--centered design strategies, evocative artwork, and powerful narratives. I am currently exploring how art, storytelling and technology can be used to revolutionize the untapped potential of time spent in waiting rooms of clinics. At some point in our lives, we all become patients and are challenged with accepting illness as a part of being human. Chronic disease is an ongoing natural disaster of the body, where the tsunami is a never-ending undulation of change. This disaster leaves in its wake a real sense of fear, isolation and heightened awareness of the fragility of one's body. Many illnesses that are depicted in the media have a narrative that has a beginning, middle and end--a flowing arc to the story. But most illnesses, especially those that are chronic, lack an arc or even a narrative that makes sense to the outsider. Sometimes it can feel overwhelming, lonely, or diminishing. I create with the intent to transform this experience and use a medium that fosters connections and conversation. In doing so I aim to open up people's eyes to see the unique perspectives gained through living with disease. Elizabeth Jameson is an artist and writer who explores what it means to live in an imperfect body as part of the universal human experience. Before her diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, she served as a public interest lawyer representing incarcerated children; she later represented children living with chronic illnesses and disabilities in their attempts to receive medically necessary care. As her disease progressed, she began using her MRI's to create art as a way of reclaiming agency of her own medical data. She transformed the unsettling, clinical images into work that invites people to open up conversations about what it means to have an illness or disability. She now writes personal essays and speaks across the country sharing her experiences living with illness and disability. Her essays have been published by The New York Times, British Medical Journal, WIRED magazine, and MIT's Leonardo Journal. Her essay, \"Losing Touch, Finding Intimacy,\" was included in the New York Times book,About Us, released in September 2019 by Norton Publishing.

    "data": "By Val Walker Could anything make you feel lonelier than having no one to take you home after a medical procedure? Before the day of the procedure, single older adults scramble to find a ride for their colonoscopy or endoscopy, asking friends, neighbors, family members, colleagues, church members--you essentially go begging--but no one can be pinned down to pick you up. These days, medical centers have moved as much of their services to outpatient procedures and day surgeries where patients are moved through the pipes like an assembly line. So, they expect their patients to have a trusted ride at the ready to sign off so they can whisk you through and release you to someone \"responsible.\" This is especially tricky when a patient has anesthesia and cannot simply take an Uber or hire a ride service, or use public transportation, or use the volunteer ride services that senior centers offer. For single older adults like me, I had to reschedule my endoscopy four times because my friend or neighbor or chosen ride fell through at the last minute. I was given hurried, dismissive advice by my medical center to just call my local senior center or call a medical transport service. Sometimes these services had been discontinued, or did not qualify, or cost more than $300 for a ride. There is a pervasive misconception that any older adult can simply call their local senior center or grab a volunteer from church for a ride to a medical appointment. But I told everyone who so casually handed me lists of ride services that a procedure involving anesthesia in an outpatient facility would not accept a driver from any organization due to liability concerns. Some of us stranded seniors who've fallen through these cracks have flat out given up on bothering to get ourselves the care we need. This flakiness and chaos with finding reliable rides caused my biopsy to be delayed for four months. I was feeling more and more frustrated and worried, but far worse, I was falling into a pit of feeling lonelier, downright abandoned (does anyone give a rat's ass?) that no one could keep their commitment or go out of their way to help me get that long-overdue biopsy. Did my friends or anyone care that abnormal cells were already growing in those membranes? I already had thyroid cancer four years ago and I sorely needed this next biopsy for my Barrett's esophagus and abnormal cell changes in the membranes of my throat. But I could find no one, after a good 60 attempts to find people for a ride. Sure, I was \"well-connected,\" but could I count on anyone? Finally, I resorted to scheduling a home health agency and having to pay $120 just for a ride home (and that's pretty cheap these days). Paying for this certainly meant I had to go without other basic needs (had to use the food pantry). Not only is this predicament unfair financially and medically for isolated adults who are forced to delay important, perhaps life-saving procedures--it hurts us most in our hearts and makes us feel uncared for and unloved. Yes, I am being emotional here, but I believe most of my fellow solo agers out there on their own fighting for basic health care feel just as lonely and abandoned. And to tell the truth, I'm sure I'm not the only one who was haunted by an inner demon nagging at them saying, \"So who cares if these cells turn into cancer--maybe it's time to get out of Dodge.\" And yet, with just a little more help from those friends around us, an early cancer can be spotted by one single act of kindness--a ride home from an endoscopy. So, I've said it: Our health care system can make solo agers feel even lonelier when left to their own devices to scrounge up someone to drive them home from an overdue biopsy. And if we cannot find anyone available or willing without having to pay for them to help us, our sense of isolation and abandonment might weaken our will to keep fighting--and our will to live. That's what social isolation really means. That's one way it can kill us. What do you think?

    "data": "By Steve Buechler I would never recommend cancer as a way of learning life lessons. But having \"been there,\" I have tried to \"do that.\" Cancer treatment required coping strategies. Surviving it taught important lessons. Both remain surprisingly relevant in an ongoing pandemic. My Cancer Odyssey In June of 2016, I was anticipating one more year of teaching sociology before a carefree retirement. Life was good in every way. But a routine physical revealed dangerously low white blood cell counts. My doctor referred me to a hematologist who recommended a bone marrow biopsy that detected acute myeloid leukemia. Within 48 hours, I was hospitalized and began a week-long, 24/7 chemotherapy cocktail. My hospitalization continued for the next 35 days. After chemotherapy, I became severely immunosuppressed and battled a number of predictable side-effects. By my fourth week, things improved, and a repeat biopsy revealed no evidence of leukemia. That meant I would live long enough to explore options for further treatment. My cancer had an \"intermediate risk\" of relapse so I faced a difficult decision between more chemotherapy or a stem cell transplant. After researching my options and getting second opinions, I chose transplant. My logic was that if I had more chemotherapy and it didn't work out, I would regret not pursing the transplant. If I had the transplant and it didn't work out, at least I would feel as if I gave it my best shot. In October of 2016, I received a double cord blood stem cell transplant. It was preceded by high dose chemotherapy and full body radiation to gradually destroy my compromised immune system. It was followed by two and a half weeks of recuperation before hospital discharge. Engraftment happened surprisingly quickly. I had playfully named my baby donors \"Ralph\" and \"Gwen.\" Three weeks after transplant, yet another biopsy revealed that Ralph was 99% engrafted. We've been getting along ever since. After a month of extreme fatigue, bone aches, and lingering nausea, several milestones followed. One month out, my daily clinic visits became less frequent. Three months out, I began tapering my anti-rejection medications. Six months out, I stopped those and a dozen other medications. Nine months out, I gave the keynote address at my transplant unit's fundraiser before 400 people. One year out, Ralph and I got our childhood vaccinations from dead viral sources to replace the originals that had been rendered inactive by the transplant. Two years out, we got additional immunizations from live viruses. In retrospect, I hit the treatment trifecta. I got into remission on the first try. Ralph fully engrafted in three weeks. And I've had no graft-vs.-host-disease. In the sweet words of my transplant oncologist, \"this is as good as it gets.\" My Coping Strategies When I was told to expect an initial 5-week hospital stay, I was dumbfounded. I realized I needed ways to cope with how my world had suddenly become very small and quite precarious. Over the ensuing weeks, I cultivated several strategies. I practiced mindfulness, meditation, and yoga. It helped me banish thoughts about the past and anxieties about the future, and to non-judgmentally accept and live in each moment as it unfolded. I did as much physical exercise as my circumstances allowed, including stretching, isometric exercises, hall walking. I did it mindfully, and these routines increased my energy and lifted my spirits. I was a pro-active patient. I made my bed, organized my hospital room, and structured my days with new routines of meditation, exercise, writing and yoga. I actively collaborated with my medical team in managing my care. Being in charge of these activities gave me agency and purpose when these were hard to come by. I maintained my sense of humor. Sharing jokes and witty banter with my medical providers broke the ice and humanized our consults. It also gave friends and family a way to relate to me as the person I'd always been rather than the patient I'd recently become. I relied on a supportive belief system. For some, that's religion. For me, it was a secular worldview based on my social science background. It encouraged me to learn about my illness and treatment, and it fostered a practical, problem-solving approach to the challenges they posed. Finally, I wrote my story. I sent detailed reports about my status and reflections to a large group of email correspondents. Writing for others forced me to understand my odyssey so I could articulate it for them. This writing became a psychic survival mechanism (and a memoir). I'll never know if these strategies contributed to my physical survival, but I always know they preserved my sanity and sustained my identity during one of the most harrowing periods of my life. I also benefitted from some privileged circumstances. After a year of paid sick leave, I retired with a steady income and a home that's paid for. Within that context of material security, my coping strategies have sustained my physical, psychological and emotional health. Coping Strategies Redux These strategies have also proven quite relevant during the coronavirus pandemic. Mindfulness continues to keep me grounded in the present moment and allows me to banish anxieties if I cannot take specific actions to address the causes of my concerns. It also reminds me not to look too far ahead and rather take each day as it comes. My repertoire of physical activity now includes a cautious return to my health club for lap swimming and strength training. The physical and psychological benefits during this pandemic are inestimable. My proactive stance toward organizing my small hospital world now plays out in a slightly larger arena at home. But there remain limits and prohibitions on things I would like to do. I draw on my acquired skills to focus on what I can control. That helps me live within these limitations, find new projects, and structure my days with activities still available to me. My sense of humor remains intact. It reminds me not to sweat the small stuff, and that it's almost all small stuff. And for the few things that really are big stuff, black humor works well. The secular, problem-solving worldview that guided me through cancer treatment is especially apt for following and implementing the latest medical advice and cautions about living as safely as possible in the midst of an ever-evolving pandemic. Finally, writing my story (including this blog post) still helps me make sense of my circumstances and find ways of acting intelligently and responding effectively to whatever life brings my way. Further Lessons for a COVID-19 World There are additional lessons from my cancer odyssey that are helpful in this pandemic. Cancer taught me that asymptomatic people who feel healthy can in fact be quite ill. That describes me upon my diagnosis, and quite a few people who are unwittingly infecting others with coronavirus now. Cancer vanquished my sense of invulnerability. Having been in good health for my first 64 years, I still harbored a teenager's sense of invincibility. But we can all get sick with little notice, for no particular rhyme or reason. Cancer taught me to be at peace with isolation. I learned to spend time alone and be resolute, whether in a hospital room or a pandemic lockdown. Cancer taught me to await test results calmly. \"Scanxiety\" doesn't change the result but can be debilitating to our energy and outlook. Cancer taught me to value masks. Whether protecting me during chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression or protecting others from a contagious virus, masks are essential to caring for ourselves and others. Cancer taught me the value of patience during a prolonged and uncertain recovery. It was a marathon, not a sprint. Moreover, the marathon involved an obstacle course of impediments. Facing such challenges, patience is indeed a virtue. Cancer taught me resilience. One of my favorite images is a three-legged cat who doesn't mope and withdraw, but just continues silly cat antics despite the handicap. Facing impediments, I've learned to just get on with things. Cancer fostered a deep respect for the skill, wisdom, and dedication of doctors and nurses. It taught me to be the best patient I could be for them, and now to follow their evolving pandemic guidelines for everyone's sake. Cancer underscored the role of chance in life. Things sometimes happen for no apparent reason, but we still must make the best decisions we can with the incomplete, imperfect and ever-changing information we have. Cancer made me humble about what I can control. It's a lot less than I would like to think but recognizing that saves a lot of energy and keeps me on an even keel. Cancer left me a deep well of gratitude for the life I still have and taught me to live as judiciously and mindfully as I can ... and to enjoy the ride. As I said at the beginning, cancer is a terrible way to learn life lessons. But perhaps the most important lesson of all is to make the most of the hand you're dealt.

    "data": "Elaine Scarry, Harvard English professor and advocate for narrative medicine, said: \"To have great pain is to have certainty; to hear that another person has pain is to have doubt.\" We can never truly know what someone else's pain feels like, or truly understand another's experience with illness or injury. But we are mistaken if we think that this gives us reason not to try. As two sophomore Nursing majors and Medical Humanities minors at Boston College, we feel a personal responsibility to give voice to stories of pain--including the suffering associated with physical, emotional, and mental illness and stress we have heard from our peers. We also feel called to elicit and validate the stories of pain which haven't yet been told. Many suffer silently every day on campus, and our hope is to provide space for these people to share their stories and thus feel less isolated. \"Underheard HSC\" (@underheard_hsc), the Instagram account we've launched, is dedicated to sharing anonymous short health stories and art pieces by and from college students. It aims to make stories of illness, disability, and loss in college more accessible to the students facing these challenges, to encourage those who aren't naturally inclined to write about their experiences to share their stories, and to help those who haven't experienced such challenges to join in conversations about health and illness with those around them. In college, there is great stigma around diseases or injuries that are considered unusual in our age group. We are expected to be young, strong, and resilient to whatever comes our way. This presumption of healthiness makes it challenging for those who undergo debilitating illnesses to express themselves. When these experiences are under-discussed, it leads to misunderstandings about the reality of being sick, and about how to best respond to and care for those around us who are experiencing these challenges. For this reason, we are particularly interested in reaching college students through our work as interns at Health Story Collaborative. Our hope is that Underheard HSC becomes a space where young people feel less alone in their pain and comfortable enough to submit quotes or short stories about their own health. Each of us has or will deal with health challenges in our lifetime. It's time to start talking about it. By taking the time to listen to and express care for the stories of our peers, we will not only be showing them kindness, but we will also begin to make space for a kind of storytelling which can lead to emotional healing. Our greatest ambition is to inspire better communication and deeper human connection. We hope that this platform welcomes students to share and serves to validate and honor every health story. Supporting unique projects and starting new conversations can sometimes be scary, but the barriers to discussing the difficulties of illness which we have comfortably hidden behind until now are the very reason we must take a leap and open our minds to the infinite stories of illness and pain existing around us. Please join us in taking a small but important step in showing our peers that we care: follow @underheard_hsc on Instagram. For questions or to submit a story, please email Evelyn and Heena at hscinterns@gmail.com. Heena Nissaraly is a sophomore at Boston College majoring in Nursing and minoring in Medical Humanities. She aims to become an empathic nurse specialized in anesthesia or hospice care, and hopes to eventually improve healthcare in Madagascar. Evelyn Caty is a sophomore at Boston College majoring in Nursing and minoring in Medical Humanities. She discovered for herself the utter inexpressibility of pain when she suffered from undiagnosed back pain for many years, and she hopes to use this knowledge to encourage her peers struggling with health challenges to begin healing through the telling of their own stories. She, too, hopes to use her passion for the medical humanities and for storytelling to become a compassionate and effective nurse.",

    "data": "By Alison Rosalie Brookes, MD I have held only one person's hands recently; and hugged and kissed only that one person, but I have been growing deeply fond of and emotionally wrapped in the arms of, lots of people whose faces I have never seen. People speaking in Spanish and sometimes in English, have been telling me their stories in the hope that I might be able to help them a little bit. They have been breathing for me into their cellphones as I Iisten for wheezes, and they have texted me photographs of their hands and feet. They have trusted me with their concerns and shared their fears. The fear of going to work, and the fear that staying home will cost them their livelihoods. The worry about finding enough food to eat, and how much they miss their loved ones, alone in the hospital. Sometimes the worst has already happened. I have been laughing with them as well, mostly because my Spanish can be quite unintentionally funny, praying with them, receiving their blessings, and to be honest I have actually cried a few times with them too. I usually work in a miraculous little gem of a medical outpatient clinic; hidden away in plain sight in the shabbiest, oldest building of Boston's most beloved hospital. There, we provide wonderful medical care to people who come from all over the world, and also from right around the corner. When COVID-19 descended upon us, our clinic was converted overnight into Boston's first \"RIC\", (Respiratory Illnesses Clinic) and suddenly we were confronting its reality head on. That is a story for another day, but I am here to tell you about Chelsea. As an older physician, I was deployed to work remotely; backing up the nurses taking calls from people who receive their care at the Chelsea Health Center. My day begins at about 8.30am, with a list of messages from two nurses whose faces I have never seen, but who have become beloved friends. For 8 weeks now, we have shared our days, good and bad, and we have been bearing witness to the way that this virus does, most definitely, discriminate. It discriminates most viciously against the people we speak with, all day, from the safety of our kitchens. The essential workers, and their families, have suffered greatly. We might not, in normal times even really see them or notice the work they do, but we all depend on them to supply our food, our power, our sanitation and other public services. They care for our loved ones in nursing homes, and they clean the buildings in which we live and work. They tend to be poorly paid and live in crowded conditions. They bear a burden of poor health that puts them at much greater risk of becoming infected with, and succumbing to, the worst effects of this virus. Our job is to answer their phone calls and listen to their concerns, and then we do whatever we can to help. We never cease to be humbled and inspired by the enormity of what our patients are going through, and the fortitude they need to withstand it all. Suddenly, ensconced in this new life, gratefully immersed in the embrace of Chelsea, where the poetic Spanish language of South America mixes surprisingly well with the grittiness of life in Massachusetts, my father, in London, known to all of us as Daddy, did not wake up. The early morning call came from my sister and two brothers, who had miraculously been allowed into Daddy's room at the care home, in London. They had not seen each other, or Daddy, for 6 weeks, and they were all unrecognizable in full PPE. But they were there with him and I am sure he could hear them singing together and could feel them holding his elegant, long-fingered hands. I wished I could hold his hands too, and kiss him, but instead I whispered nice things into Daddy's ears, Facetiming on my brother's cellphone. It was a long day, tranquil, with some funny moments, because it was Daddy after all, who was always apt to suddenly burst out laughing at inappropriate moments. Yet we all knew what nightfall would bring. In the evening, as the sun was thinking about setting, and Venus was clearly visible in the night sky, my sister and two brothers decided to sing Etz Chayim Hi, (The Tree of Life,) and a few of Daddy's other favorites, including a really soppy old song called Whispering Grass. A tear ran down Daddy's left cheek and the look on his face was the same as it was in a photo we have always loved, from 63 years earlier, as he watched Mummy signing their Ketubah. Daddy's room had gone silent, and the red vixen who had been curled up all day, at the foot of a blossoming cherry tree outside the bedroom window, had disappeared. We had had the enormous privilege of being with our father at the end of his long, eccentric and brilliantly colorful life, and he had not suffered. All of us were conscious that death in the time of COVID was not usually like this. I was very sad not to be standing side by side with my siblings at Daddy's funeral. There were many people present, Zooming in from England, Israel and several states of America, and yet, according to British Orthodox rules, we didn't count as a minyan and so were not allowed to say Kaddish. The next day we had the most wonderful Zoom-shiva, which was attended by an even wider variety of people, including my new colleagues from Chelsea MA, whose faces I still have not seen because they modestly kept their video dark. We sent Daddy off in laughter and tears the way he would have liked it. We even managed to say Kaddish, despite it being against the strict rules that Daddy followed, because honoring your father sometimes involves a little disobedience. A week after Daddy died, I was back at work in my kitchen, virtually in Chelsea. When patients told me about their relatives, sick with COVID-19 in the hospital, I was pierced with emotions even more poignant than those of a week before. I know what it's like to not be able to hold your father in your arms as he passes away, but I cannot imagine what it is like to suffer the pain of not being there at all, knowing he is alone in a hospital with no visitors. I feel deep concern and compassion for the people of Chelsea, whose lives I have encountered as a result of this awful pandemic. Their culture revolves around \"carino\" which is the Spanish version of our Jewish \"chesed\". I am inspired by my heroic colleagues working on the frontlines, and gratefully humbled by the patients for whom I am caring. And, although I never thought I would say this, I am grateful for modern technology too.

    "data": "I'm sure you've heard the saying,\"It's not how many times you fall that matters; it's how many times you get back up.\" It's a great message, but to me, at least in my circumstances, it doesn't tell the whole story. Don't get me wrong, getting up from a fall, whether physical or emotional, is incredibly important. Learning to pick yourself back up is a valuable skill, and is representative of a special type of grit and determination that's needed to get through the realities of life. But there's more to it. As someone who is well-versed in falling after nine years living with Miyoshi Myopathy, an adult-onset form of muscular dystrophy, I've become an expert on the subject, for better or worse. I've fallen all sorts of ways - I've tripped on cobblestone sidewalks, I've stumbled getting off a bus, and I've been knocked over by oblivious strangers engrossed in their iPhones. I've even fallen over after sneezing. Even with the greatest of precautions, it doesn't take much to fall, especially now that I'm nine years into this disease, a physical shell of my former self. As a serial faller, it often feels like the famous saying has been turned around on me:It's not how many times you pick yourself back up, it's how many more times you're going to fall now that you are upright again. Falling, as you can imagine, is no fun. It's not something I'll ever quite get used to. But thankfully, so far, I've gotten back up every time, although in the last few years I've needed the help of others to do so. Assistance or not, there is pride in getting up after a fall, dusting myself off, and continuing on with life. However, it isn't from the act of getting back up where I've learned life's most important lessons; it's on the ground post-fall. It is here -on the cold, miserable pavement, or the hard wooden floor, or the cushiony carpeting (oh look, the Cheerio from yesterday's breakfast), where I've had to confront the sobering realities of my life, mainly, that my disease isn't going to get better anytime soon, if ever. Lying on the ground, unsure how I'm going to get back up, is terrifying. Every time it happens, my body trembles, my heart races uncontrollably. I often feel like I could pass out, that is, if I don't throw up first. But it is in these most frustrating moments after a fall where I have found the resolve to keep going, unlocking strength I never knew I had. I found this resolve - to continue living my life despite the weighty knowledge of what lies ahead - ironically enough, after trying to give up. It was middle of winter in early 2013, and I was going on five years dealing with increasing muscle weakness that I knew was only going to get worse with time. That night, on a side street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I fell for the umpteenth time, but it was the first time I couldn't pick myself back up using my own strength. Instead, I had to crawl over to a parked car and use it as leverage to stand up again. When I finished, exhausted, I plopped myself onto the hood. I wanted to quit life right then and there. Over the years, I had suppressed my emotions, putting on a strong facade to keep myself sane day after day. But on this night, it was all just too much. I had fallen twice in five minutes, and if the car wasn't there to bail me out, I might have taken myself up on the alternate option to crawl under a nearby bush and wait for life to pass me by. In those dark moments on the ground, when I failed over and over again to get up - first with my body weight, then with a flimsy metal fence that never had a chance to support me - I thought this was going to become my life, my future. Fall. Get up somehow. Fall again. My life reduced to perverse clockwork. On the hood of the car, I felt an exhaustion I had never felt before, and have never since. It was a combination of physical exhaustion and emotional burnout. I had used all my strength to get up onto the hood, after crawling 20 feet to even get to the car, after failing twice to get up, after having fallen again five minutes before that and pulling myself up using a stronger fence further down the street. Giving up was not only an emotional decision, it felt perfectly rational.How could I deal with this every day? And it's supposed to get worse from here? Deep down though, I couldn't give up. Maybe it was my subconscious giving me a jolt, telling me to snap out of it, or maybe it was a divine nudge reminding me I had so much yet to live for - I believe it was both. Eventually, I pried myself from the hood of the car and walked, ever so carefully, the remaining block to my apartment. It was only months later that I could fully understand how that experience was a turning point in my life. The falls haven't gotten any easier since then, but in finding my inner strength that night - and I had to really be pushed to brink to find it - I gained a new confidence. I realized that if I could withstand the pavement, the failed attempts to get up, the dark thoughts that swirled through my mind, even the knowledge that falls like this would become a regular occurrence, I could withstand anything. Suddenly, dreams that were dashed no longer seemed impossible. Doors that had closed in my face opened once again. No problem seemed insurmountable. This audio clip, recorded on the phone and edited by Dr. Annie Brewster, chronicles my nine-year journey, back to 2008, when I was first diagnosed and started feeling symptoms, on through the present day. My life these last nine years feels like a three-act play - Act 1: Denial, Act II: Depression, Act III: Acceptance. I am in a better place today, although I still fall, and still occasionally wonder if there is a limit to how much frustration I can take. But it is from these moments on the ground, when I am forced to confront the magnitude of my disease, watching helplessly as the mobility of my former life slips further out of reach, that I have learned to let go. To let go of the feeling of permanence that each fall brings. To let go of the notion that this is all my life has been reduced to. To let go of what I can't control. Falling is merely one activity - albeit a miserable one - in a life that is so much more than my muscle weakness. Falling can be physical or emotional, but it happens to all of us, repeatedly, even with the most careful planning. I hope that my story - and my lessons learned from the pavement - can be one of many stories that you can refer to when life knocks you down. Because, as I learned the hard way, and as the great saying should have gone, it's not how many times you fall that matters. It's not even how many times you get back up. What matters is knowing that you are going to fall again, and when you do, that the sidewalk is powerless to stop you. You are more resilient than you know.",

    "data": "By Susan Epstein Interesting, the different paths life offers, the lessons learned, and the irony of it all. A lifetime of experiences cannot always prepare you for what's ahead, but the hope is you will have learned enough strategies to deal with whatever comes your way. And then something like lung cancer hits. When you are faced with a dreadful diagnosis, what is there to fight back with? There was no point in falling into \"Why me?\" I had to go deep, all the way back to an athletic career that I once cherished, but then abruptly ended, leaving me with a sense of failure and loss. Competitive running had been my life, until it wasn't. 1986 The summer of '86 was going to be the first time I had taken a trip to Europe if I made the cut. I had qualified to run the10,000 meters (6.2 miles) track event at the prestigious Bislett Games in Oslo, Norway but needed the funds to cover the travel. New Balance, my sponsor of eight years, was eager for me to compete through the summer and agreed to send me along. At midnight, under bright skies in this Norwegian town, I ran twenty-five laps around the 400-meter track in 33:12, far from my personal best, but a solid performance considering this was my first track race overseas. Ingrid Kristiansen, a native, lapped the entire field, setting a world record in 30:13. The top Americans would be flying out the next day for Moscow to compete in the inaugural Goodwill Games, created by the cable television tycoon, Ted Turner. Mr. Turner was making a dream come true after the US boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games. He organized the event as a way to ease tensions during the Cold War through friendly athletic competition between nations. This would be the first time in 11 years that athletes from the Soviet Union and the United States competed on the same playing ground in a major international event. Having placed 5th at our US National Championships, I was not considered for the team traveling to Russia. As timing had it though, Mr. Turner wanted to broaden the women's field and was looking for an athlete to make the trip to Red Square. I was respected as a marathon runner, ranked 10th in the world in 1983, just missing a spot on the '84 Olympic Team. The disappointment was tremendous, but I finally bounced back in 1985 placing 5th at the New York City Marathon, crossing the finish line as the first American female. My agent passed my name on to Mr. Turner knowing I would be in Europe, and the deal was sealed. The only catch, I would be running the 5000 meters (3.1 miles) a mere sprint for someone more accustomed to the 26-mile marathon event. Still, I was thrilled to be wearing USA across my chest. Stepping out on the track, on a hot July evening in the packed Olympic stadium, I watched the other runners in awe as they went through their pre-race routines. I was overcome by emotion knowing that I was the 4th American woman representing our country. The horn sounded and the competitors lined up on the eight-lane track, 20 of the fastest women in the world. Each runner was introduced in front of the crowd of 100,000 as their respective country flag was raised. The stars and stripes directly in my view, I thought to myself, \"This is my Olympics.\" The gun fires and the runners are bunched tightly. Running somewhere in the middle of the pack, I came through the first mile in 4:51, astounding since my best open mile ever was 4:48. I didn't feel anything at first, just concentrated on pace and strategy to avoid being tripped. The field began to spread out with the Russians blocking Cindy Bremser, our top US entry, from taking the lead. My only goal was to run my personal record (PR) and finish strongly. A good friend of mine from Belgium, Ria Van Landeghem, a fellow marathoner, was just a few strides in front of me. I was struggling to stay with her, sweat stinging my eyes, legs dead weight, all side effects from running that first mile too fast. My instincts were to push through the fatigue, but my body rebelled. I remember thinking it was so hot, hotter than the hardest training days in Dallas, Texas, and knew this was not a good sign. With all the excitement up front, the two Russians beating Cindy by eight seconds, I was able to finish the race without much attention to the back of the pack. I finished in a respectable 8th place but walked off the track bathed in fatigue with feelings of failure. On an easy five-mile morning run the following day, Ria asked what happened to me; she assumed I was going to pass her on the final lap thinking I had greater leg speed. I laughed...leg speed, more like dead legs! I shrugged it off and attributed it to poor pacing. I continued the tour from Birmingham, England to Wales, to Paris and back to London, racing in shorter-distance events of 1500 and 3000 meters. My mediocre performances along the way caused me to curtail my track season and head back home to our U.S. training facility in Dallas. I would undergo numerous physiological tests at the Human Performance Lab, led by my coach Robert Vaughan, Ph.D. The usual battery of exercise tests and blood values were taken at various workloads. The test results revealed my season was over. In exercise physiology terms I had \"over-trained.\" This was a common conclusion when athletes started performing poorly without any concrete explanation or solid evidence to support. The treatment: easy running and no competition for several months. The setback brought back lingering negative thoughts causing me to question the path my running career had taken me. 2000 Much had been accomplished since my departure from the track & field world, leaving behind the highs and the lows of a once so important athletic career. A graduate degree in exercise physiology was a natural progression after retirement, but then that subject too, became all too consuming. I continued my academic journey and completed a master's degree in speech pathology, a field I thought would take me far away from the study of diet and exercise. During the years that followed, I maintained my weight to a more ideal standard, exercised recreationally learning tennis for the first time, and took stock in relationships with family and friends. After settling in Buffalo, New York, where I raised two amazing daughters, competitive running had taken a permanent back seat. A career in neuro-rehabilitation opened the door to the fascinating world of the brain, this organ inside our head that controls all bodily functions of a human being.I had totally underestimated this complex structure which controls thought, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, temperature, hunger, and every part of our being. After solely depending on my body for running, I was surprised how I took my brain for granted. Joining the neurology team at Buffalo General Hospital changed that notion. Of course, speech and language skills are housed in the brain, but healthy living had to be part of the prescription as well. I began to combine health behaviors, such as sorting fruits and vegetables, with cognitive retraining. Preventative health behaviors became as important as the speech therapy session. My motivation came from the devastation I saw in my patients' lives following a stroke or those living with multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease. Every aspect of a person's being was affected. Many lost their vocation, their ability to communicate, and much of their livelihood. The department of neurology, newly named the Jacobs Neurological Institute (JNI), became the forerunner in using a wellness model for treatment instead of the traditional disease model. While the scientists were at work developing treatments and cures, my job was to make each patient healthier to prevent secondary disease, such ascancer,stroke, or heart disease. However, quality of life(QOL) should be the focus of all intervention. Then again, what does quality of life look like exactly? I certainly had learned a great deal after surrendering to the solitary life of an elite athlete and sought out to develop a doable program for people to find happiness and life satisfaction through adopting a menu of healthy behaviors. Diet and exercise, the usual prescription, had to be tailored differently for those with compromised health, limited mobility, and low motivation. Hence, I developed the LIFE program (Lifestyle, Independence, Fitness, and Energy); a simple can-do approach to regaining confidence and satisfaction living with a new normal. Due to the success of the 12-week program, I went on to author a book based on the foundations. The LIFE Program for MS was published by Oxford University Press in 2009. The irony...the LIFE program was to become the \"new normal\" for me. 2020 NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) Adenocarcinoma of the lung was the diagnosis. NSCLC is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung, usually found in smokers, but can occur in non-smokers as well. With disbelief, I rehearsed in my head that lung cancer was not supposed to strike a former world-class runner, one who dedicated her career to helping people learn to live well despite chronic disease. I was dumbfounded to say the least. The mass had been growing for five years, ignored by several physicians, when in fact some indication of a problem was noted on two CAT Scans taken in 2015; but \"I looked so good.\" Ironically, I could still run, play tennis, and remain physically active, all of which disguised the illness. Finally, the medical treatment: surgical removal of the entire lower lobe of my right lung, followed by chemotherapy. But the \"QOL\" remedy was totally in my hands. 2023 I couldn't figure out where I was going with this story until today, when I was playing tennis with some great gals. It was just one of those days where my double's partner and I played well coming from behind to win. Regardless of the victory, we were doubled over with laughter just enjoying ourselves, not taking the game too seriously. My lung cancer has come back, despite my optimism and healthy living. However, my \"QOL\" remedy is stronger than ever, and will again defeat the disease. What have I learned since letting go of my singular life as an athlete? The crucial need to build healthy behaviors that enhance one's happiness and life satisfaction. It is simply finding the laughter and joy in friendships. Of course, there's more to my recipe for living with Cancer and I attribute this newfound strength to the life I rebuilt after defeat on the playing field. The 3-F's...faith, family, and friends are the basic ingredients, and then you add service to others, add a touch of intellectual stimulation, some musical notes from my choir, and yes, healthy eating and exercise. And perhaps a glass of wine or two. There you have it, my personal recipe. Sue J. King Epstein is a native of Birmingham, Alabama and now calls Western New York her home.

    "data": "By Ashley Lynch My New Hampshire Colonial-style house sat at the edge of a cul-de-sac, and this is the house we still live in today. Despite regular renovations and repairs, I sometimes feel the house has aged more than I have in tangible years, and attempts to fix the house have resulted in an altered-kind-of Botox look after a few too many surgeries--different from the original, fixed but in an unfamiliar way. When I was younger, the cul-de-sac seemed expansive, and to leave the end of my street was not something I pondered without the presence of my family. When I was young, my mom was my only caretaker and main source of comfort, to the point where even being close to her could serve as a security blanket. As a shy kid, I would sometimes attempt to escape meeting new people or interacting with strangers by hiding near my mom's feet, covering myself with the bottom of her summer dress as a makeshift disguise. Her wardrobe rotated through a few calf-length, heavily-worn dresses, some I recognized as purchases from Walmart and others I knew to be gifts from the maternity section from my aunt. My mom struggled with holding weight around her midsection, and I remember her initial offense and later realization that these clothes helped to shape her form a bit more nicely. As a toddler, I can recall I would only venture to leave the house on my own if I could not immediately find my mom. One hazy, humid summer morning, my twin and I heaved open the front door because we did not see mom and were met with the feeling of insecurity, of momentary anxious abandonment. It was early enough that clouds still covered the promise of sunlight. My bare feet were instantly chilled by the cool nighttime still clutched by our stone front steps. I leaped to the neighboring grass for temperature relief and decided I preferred the slightly more pleasant feeling of sticky, damp grass; the layer of dew provided the grass with increased shear force for the blades to get stuck between my stubby toes. Mom was talking with an unfamiliar technician, and Sarah and I were relieved to have found her. \"Uppie,\" Sarah repeated our familial, conditioned word in asking to be picked up, to be comforted after a few moments of lostness without Mom's presence. Our gray house was the most familiar physical place I knew, but this familiarity lost its relief when our emotional source of comfort was not there, making us cinnamon toast or joining us to watch cartoons. Sarah outstretched her arms; even though Sarah was asking for this affection, mom's physical comfort was not a question, and she was swept up before I could fully raise my arms as well. \"Uppie,\" I repeated in turn. I was the second twin to be delivered and sometimes still following in Sarah's footsteps. \"No,\" my mom looked down for a moment, still in conversation with the stranger, \"I can't pick you both up anymore. You're too heavy. Sarah needs this more.\" Sarah's autism diagnosis was recent, and one that I would not fully understand for many years to come. As a toddler, it was implanted in my brain as a lesson, as essential as the alphabet and number line, that Sarah faced extra difficulties and needed more attention and support. By the age of four, mom told me I was old enough to get dressed on my own, but I still found it hard to differentiate the neck and arm holes or feel confident in deciding which clothes matched. We are twins, and eighteen years later Sarah receives help getting dressed to this day. Growing up with Sarah requiring an institutionalized level of care for years, I was frozen in this yearning, young pose, with my arms still reaching up. I found myself reasserting my need for attention as we grew up. Sarah required more care on all levels, and simple communication with my mom could seem unfathomable. My arms attempted to stretch a distance of a thousand miles, and this distance grew even when my mom and I existed in the same home. In our kitchen, there used to be a bar-top counter attached to the longest wall, with two wooden chairs placed beneath the pale counter, one stool uneven and rickety in its balance. Covering this wall was a large mirror that made the kitchen seem larger than it actually was; some of the repairmen who entered into the house would express their initial confusion, thinking the mirror represented the other half of the room or an open table instead of a sheltered countertop. My mom spent the majority of her time home typing at this space. Although this mirror is no longer in the kitchen, I can still envision my mom's reflection here: her slightly-bent posture, how the wrinkles on her forehead and typing hands were less noticeable in this image than face-to-face, and her utter concentration on the screen. When I would attempt to speak to her while she was here, she would look back at me through the mirror, or answer without shifting her gaze from the laptop. Over time, I longed for eye contact that didn't take place through a reflection. I know now that this stretching of distance between us was unpreventable, and due to Sarah's circumstances, my mom was truly not available. I am not sure whether she was aware of this. After her initial diagnosis, Sarah was assigned to work full time with an in-house behavioral management specialist, who operated with support from a larger behavior management team. Despite the continued efforts of this support system, over the years two of our car windshields were shattered, one storm door was destroyed, and more holes than I can recall appeared on the wall from the force of Sarah's fist or head. Sometimes the holes would be patched up in a timely manner, but other marks of chaos lingered, and I struggled to shuffle visiting friends past these damages. I found myself arranging cafe coffee dates or simply agreeing to hang-outs I did not have to host. Growing up, the physical shape of my house felt like a part of my identity, like the clothes I chose to wear or food I selected to eat. Now that I am in college, I am not home often, but one week in the summer when I stayed in New Hampshire, I woke to screaming downstairs. In the past few months, Sarah had been experiencing psychosis, a personality shift, and tested highly positive for Lyme disease. The latter can result in neurological damage. In the process of trying out various antipsychotic medications, Sarah experienced hallucinations as a side effect. Mom had gone out for a quick trip to the grocery store, and when I found Sarah, I discovered she believed that a truck had crashed into our living room. Since moving out, I sometimes find it startling how out of touch I have become to Sarah's ongoing daily needs that mom provides. College has also given me space to reflect on my upbringing, and when I return home, I can better understand the choices my mom made as a parent as well as the tension she carried and her constant closed-off nature. During that most recent trip home, I saw a large hole in the wall of the upstairs hallway, which I had learned via text a few weeks before occurred during a challenging time with Sarah's hallucinations. Viewing the picture of the wall via text, I was initially upset that the hole appeared next to my bedroom door. Seeing the contortion of the wall in person, my heart sank, as I was able to fully make the connection that Sarah's emotional distress, confusion, and images originating from her mind caused her to hit her head against the wall in frustration. I no longer associate the physical structure I grew up with as strongly with my identity. It is still a large part of me and my early memories, but the broken facets of this location serve as indicators of endurance rather than of irreparable damage. I know that this hole in the wall has still not been plastered, but I have come to accept both the dynamics of my family and to recognize some things are not an easy fix.

    "data": "by Milena Kozlowska One of my earliest memories is awash in the bright fluorescent lights of a preschool classroom, surrounded by bold blocky colors and the smell of Elmer's glue. I sat with my legs crissed-crossed on the colorful squares of the carpet, in the center of a cluster of other students. From her chair in the front of the classroom, my teacher asked me a question. The details have long since faded from my mind. All I remember is the heat of the other kids' eyes on my neck as I stared ahead, unable to answer. Instead, I shrugged. The teacher prodded me for an answer; the kids around me tittered. Fear cemented my silence. I shrugged again. Frozen, I couldn't speak. Instead, I chewed on my lip, peeling all the skin off. I never spoke. My teachers grew frustrated with me. I would whisper in the ear of my best friend Talia during recess, but otherwise I stayed silent. Talia tried to persuade me to talk to her other friends.You can whisper to them too,she said. I shook my head and stared down at the woodchips, hiding behind a curtain of long blonde hair. I could speak to my parents and siblings at home because they already knew me. But around everyone else, my throat closed up. My voice fled. Silence sheltered me. I built walls around my inner world like a fortress. As if I could escape by making myself as small and still and silent as possible. In kindergarten, all the kids sat in a circle and the teachers led us in song and dance. I never opened my mouth or moved my hands, just watched the other kids. After class, I went to the bathroom at my house and climbed up onto the sink. There were multiple mirrors, so I could see dozens of versions of myself spreading beyond me, one after another after another after another. Surrounded by reflections, I went through all the moves we'd learned in class, sang the songs under my breath. All versions of me sang and danced along. Only in that white-tiled world, with its expansive mirrors stretching infinitely on, could I speak. In the classroom, I could only watch. Silence paralyzed me. Like a princess trapped in a tower, I couldn't break down the walls of my own fortress. Even when I longed to. Teachers thought I had a developmental disorder, at first. Then I was diagnosed withselective mutism.My mom took me to see a speech therapist, a woman who sat next to me on the floor with stacks of colorful pictures. As my trust in her slowly grew, I started being able to whisper answers to her questions. Eventually, I'd been in speech therapy for long enough that I could answer direct questions if prompted. Teachers were no longer frustrated. They liked that I was quiet, polite. I didn't raise my voice or interrupt others or goof off like other kids. I kept my head down and my mouth closed and was praised for it. Meanwhile, I chewed up my lips til they were sore, scratched at my scalp till it bled, clenched my jaw till it ached. Bit my nails down to stubs, then dug them through skin already red and raw with eczema. On worksheets, I wrote in tiny handwriting, the letters as small as I could make them. As if I was trying to make myself assmallas possible, disappear between the pages. Silence stifled me. I felt like I could scream, and no one would hear behind the walls. By high school, I was speaking: shy, but no longer clinically so. At my waitressing job, cooks snapped at me for calling out orders too quietly. Whenever he saw me trying to get a cook's attention, one of my coworkers would give me a look of sympathy and ask my order, before shouting it to the kitchen himself. \"Thanks,\" I'd say with an abashed smile. \"Why do you talk like that?\" one of the cooks asked me once, in his thick accent. \"You always whisper.\" I'd ordered food for one of the residents, and he was piling the mushy vegetables onto a plate. \"This is just my voice,\" I said as he handed me the plate. \"No, it isn't.\" I laughed nervously and left to serve the food. Heat flared somewhere in the back of my throat.I'm not whispering. This is my voice. What if it wasn't? What if my real voice was still stuck somewhere I couldn't reach it? What if I'd buried it somewhere in the wood chips of my preschool playground and it was gone forever? Still, I liked some things about being quiet. I liked that people told me things they wouldn't tell others, that people called me agood listener,that most of my life was hidden, that I could keep a little mystery, a little distance. Silence protected me, both as my weapon and my refuge. Behind its walls, I could observe others without being seen, or known. But when I started college, I wanted to be someone else. I wanted to leave the mute girl behind, somewhere on the outskirts of a school playground with her knees drawn to her chest. I tried to outgrow her, outrun her, in a new place where no one would start off already knowing me asthe quiet girl.I joined rugby, a sport where I had to shout at the top of my lungs. I raised my hand in classes. I placed myself in social situations as often as possible, surrounded myself with people. I shaved my head so that I couldn't hide behind my hair anymore, even if I tried. And yet.And yet.People still kept asking me to repeat myself, became frustrated with my voice.I'm sorry,I said, over and over again.I know I'm a little soft-spoken.No matter how often I tried to raise my voice, that never seemed to change. Silence found me, again and again and again. I tried to knock down the stone walls that wrapped around my vocal cords, but I could only ever break away parts of them. The rest crumbled into rocks in my throat: I could speak, but it was never easy. It loosened its hold in me, but I could never escape it completely. And yet.At one time, silence kept me safe. In some ways, it still does. It has been with me so long, I don't know who I'd be without it. It's a part of me-- for better or worse.

    "data": "Segment 5 in our seriesSoul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill by Shaler McClure Wright I'd like to thank Health Story Collaborative for working with me to bring you \"Soul Chronicles for the Chronically Ill.\" This monthly audio column offers a soulful perspective on navigating the unique challenges of living with ongoing health conditions. My name is Shaler McClure Wright and I'm a writer/artist living with Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. Have you ever wondered how you might describe youressence? The part of you most connected to your soul? Last month we considered Carl Jung's belief that body and soul are not two things, they are one. With that in mind, our essencewould also be the part of us most connected to ourbody. And for those of us with chronic illness, we'd be hard pressed to imagine anything with a stronger connection than that! Let's take a moment to imagine our illness as our essence... Your first reaction is probably shock, or even horror. \"What! I'messentially ill?\" So let's try a softer approach. Let's imagine that instead of spending our time and energy trying to ignore our discomforts, we shift and allow ourselves to see our chronic condition as a major, ongoing presence. After all, it's as much a part of us as our heartbeat. \"Renaissance doctors believed the essence of each person originates as a star in the heavens,\" says spiritual writer Thomas Moore in his book \"Care of the Soul.\" To me, this means we have an inherent connection to something greater than ourselves, and our essence is shaped by that connection. And if our essence is chronic illness, then it, too, is connected to something greater than ourselves, with all the mystery that implies. If we can imagine our illness having deeper meaning, then we can open to the possibility of discovering hidden aspects of our connection. Moore goes on to suggest a connection between our essence and oursuffering--which we might visualize as a connection between ourillnessand our suffering: \"It is a beast, this thing that stirs in the core of our being, but it is also the star of our innermost nature. We have to care for this suffering with extreme reverence so that, in our fear and anger at the beast, we do not overlook the star.\" - Thomas Moore, \"Care of the Soul\" I love Moore's concept of approaching our suffering with reverence. It leads me to wonder how we might also approach ourillnesswith reverence. How might that change our perspective? And what could there possibly be torevere? I'd like to suggest that our relationship with our illness is likely the most important physical relationship we have. That may sound alarming, but for those of us with chronic conditions, before we can enjoy any other relationship, we need to accept, understand and maintain a committed relationship with our illness. Elizabeth Nelson, Jungian scholar and author, has developed a technique for recognizing our commitments and evaluating their meaning. To begin, she invites us to shift our focus from ego to soul. Most of us, she says, sustain multiple important relationships--to people, projects, causes, and one's self--that demand time and energy. She invites us to imagine each relationship as ametaphorical marriage,to give it the weight it deserves. Dr. Nelson believes \"one must awaken to the possibility that we are trying to maintain several competing 'marriages' in life,\" then asks, \"which is your primary commitment?\" For those of us with ongoing health conditions, our primary commitment needs to be to our health, even before our commitments to partner and family. This commitment, however, may be hiding in plain sight because we don't want to think of illness as a companion who accompanies us through life. To explore the shadowy aspects of our relationship to chronic illness, we might give ourselves the exercise of writing a letter. Asking our illness what it wants and needs. Asking how we can honor our connection. In Jungian psychology this process is called active imagination. It's ok not to know how to begin. Just clear your mind, breathe, and write down whatever comes up without judgment. You may feel uncertain about writing to a chronic health condition rather than a person. You may feel without direction, but if you can allow your thoughts to wander, and remain open to the images that come to you, you'll succeed. Let's begin by using a prompt for reflection: 'If my illness is my essence, then my illness is both beast and star.' How does that make you feel about your relationship? I like to start by asking a stream of questions, until eventually one sticks, and without effort, another point of view begins to reveal itself. I'll show you what I mean by sharing a bit of my imaginary letter... \"Dear Illness, I wonder how you feel, knowing you cause me to suffer? I wonder if you consider yourself a beast? I wonder how you could ever possibly be my innermost star? My resistance to disease makes me want to run away from my body, but it makes you want to stay. I guess that makes you the fighter; the one who is not afraid to dirty her hands. And that makes you brave. I understand there's more than one side to you. A beast is only a beast in the eyes of its beholder, and I don't want to fear you any more. I want to touch your soft spots. I want to rub your belly at the end of the day when you stretch out in front of a fire. But I don't have a sense of your size. How much space do you take up? Are you really as massive as I fear you to be? Perhaps you're only as massive as my fear allows you to be. I feel you thump in my chest. I hear you ringing in my ears. I sense you filling my mind with white fog. I see you drenching my clothing with sweat. You're good at demanding my attention. But you also inspire me--with your strength and resilience, your willingness to dance with the unknown, your comfort with change, and your refusal to surrender--even when we can't see a path through the fog. I can honor you for our differences. I'm grateful for our differences. Perhaps I am even better off for our differences. In a way, you complete me. You're the part of me that never gives up. If you are part beast, then the beast is the most animated part of you, but not the most effective. The beast feels trapped in my body and misunderstood and is crying out for attention. The beast in you is needy. But there is another, quieter part of you, looking ahead for opportunities to escape. Perhaps that is the star in you; focused on the possibility of illuminating a path in the dark. I want to learn to see you in full--to see you as both beast and star--and I promise to hold you, my essence, just as a star holds the light of the moon.\" I hope you can see how writing this letter has revealed something new about my relationship with my illness. I now realize I want to deepen my connection, instead of trying to pretend it doesn't exist. For all of us, illness has more than one dimension, and if we can learn to see it in full, then perhaps we can be more honest about our commitment. \"A good life is nourished by making wise commitments,\" Dr. Nelson reminds us, \"And ultimately, committing wisely is care of the soul.\" Goherefor more episodes of our Soul Chronicles series.

    "data": "Listen to Sean share his story. At age 22, while a graduate student at Boston College, Sean Manning had a hemorrhagic stroke.Seemingly out of nowhere, a blood vessel in his brain \"exploded\" while he was lifting weights.In a second, he went from a physically fit guy doing squats at the gym to someone with lasting physical deficits. Only later did he learn that he had been living with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM)--an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins--in his brain, likely since birth.Without knowing it, he had always had an increased risk of vessel rupture and cerebral hemorrhage. Initially, he was in a coma. When he woke up two days later, he was in the hospital and couldn't speak or move the left side of his body. He wanted to get up and run, but wasn't able, and he felt trapped. Still, to this day, he gets a panicky feeling when he is in hospitals, overwhelmed by a sense of confinement and a desire to escape. While the days in the hospital are somewhat of a blur, he remembers struggling to come to terms with what had happened: \"Can I possibly live a life after this?\" he remembers thinking. \"Am I am going to be in a home for the rest of my life? Am I going to be in a wheelchair? I play pick-up basketball three times a week. I just dunked last week. And now you are telling me I can't walk?\" He had never before experienced such an out of control feeling and he was terrified. He describes a long process of recovery, which is ongoing. He worked his way through denial, anger, and self-pity and has come around to accepting his new reality. His three-year anniversary was in March, 2019. He still struggles with some left sided weakness and with periodic seizures, but these challenges aren't holding him back. He has successfully completed the Master's degree program in accounting he started before the stroke, but notes that his priorities and passions have shifted. He no longer wants to be an accountant. Today, he works in ambulatory practice management at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and intends to pursue a career in nonprofit consulting. His stroke caused enormous suffering in his life--something he had never experienced before--but he is finding a way forward, and acknowledges that he is now a different, and in some ways better, person than he was pre-stroke. He is more open to different experiences and perspectives; his relationships have strengthened and deepened; he is more empathic. *Mixing and sound design byDavid Goodman Music: Guitar, \"Le Conqerant\" Roxy Music, \"If There Is Something,\" 1972 Trypheme, \"White Douleur\" Thanks God for Air Emotions (freemusicarchive.org) Junkadelic Brass Orchestra, \"Baron Samedi,\" Travelling in the Footsteps (2017) Lee Rosevere, \"Trying to be Strong,\" Living with Trauma, 2018 (freemusicarchive.org) Dee Yan-Key, \"Dreamworld\" One Hour of Your Life (freemusicarchive.org)",

    "data": "By Faith Wilcox When we are isolated from our family and friends, the sparkle of life can diminish slowly. For many, the lack of a familiar daily pattern and regular interactions with colleagues can be unsettling. When these conditions are combined with uncertainty about the full impact of COVID-19 on our future security, we can begin to despair. Questions swirl in our heads. Why is this happening? How will our families stay well during this pandemic? How much will this worldwide crisis effect our financial well-being? For those of us who have experienced a life-changing illness or accident, many similar feelings and questions arise. Being treated for an illness in a hospital is isolating physically and emotionally. Being pulled from our familiar daily life and spending weeks recovering in a medical setting or at home is upsetting. We may worry if we will ever fully recover or if months of more treatments are ahead of us. We may be anxious about our ability to return to work one day. These worries are painfully familiar when I recall my completely unexpected renal cancer diagnosis, the anxiety I felt prior to my surgery, and the long months of recovery in my home. After my surgery, family and friends dropped by and visited me periodically, my husband was attentive and loving, but nonetheless I felt very isolated from the beat of life. And the ever-nagging question, \"Will my cancer recur one day?\" kept me in a state of anxiety. What rescued me from despair? The opposite--hope. Feelings of hope started to stir within me after I slowly recovered from surgery; when I witnessed signs of nature's rebirth in the spring; when I was able to return to my work and be engaged again. Yes, anxiety about my future health lingers, but I've decided to hold onto hope like a life raft in the vast sea of uncertainty. Life, once again, has taught me new lessons: Hardship, anxiety, and despair will likely be on our doorsteps one day; What matters most is how we deal with our adversity; We could run away from our troubles, hide, or despair; or We can listen for whispers of hope in the voices of the young; We can see hope in the blossoms that bloom after a long, gray winter; We can find hope when a bright star sparkles on a moonless night. So now as we face the uncertainty of COVID-19, let's do our best to find unexpected benefits like how we are gathering frequently with family and friends in live video events; let's hold onto hope for medical researchers and scientists to develop a vaccine; and let's hope for the return to active and rewarding lives ahead. About Faith: Faith Fuller Wilcox believes that self-expression through writing leads to healing. Faith learned this truth firsthand when her thirteen-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was diagnosed with a rare bone cancer that took her life. Faith's journey from grief and despair to moments of comfort and peace taught her life-affirming lessons, which she shares today through her writing. Faith is the author of Hope Is A Bright Star: A Mother's Memoir of Love, Loss and Learning to Live Again that will be published in June 2021. Faith is also the author of Facing Into The Wind: A Mother's Healing After the Death of Her Child, a book of poetry. A longtime resident of greater Boston, Faith leads a journal writing program at Mass General Hospital for Children for patients and their families designed to give participants the opportunity to express themselves, alleviate stress, celebrate victories, and honor their grief. As a member of Mass General Hospital for Children's Family Advisory Council, she works with parents and medical staff to improve the lives of patients and their families.",

    "data": "Dr. Rita Charon, founder of Narrative Medicine, is concerned with how medical students are being taught to write about their patients. \"Patients have ideas about how their stories get boiled down into abbreviations and numbers and acronyms. A 78-year-old grandmother becomes a 'diabetic with an A1C of 11.2.'\" As an internist who also mentors medical students at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, Rita coined the term \"narrative medicine\" and launched the Program in Narrative Medicine at Columbia University in 2000. Her goal is to help healthcare professionals improve communication and collaboration with their patients, and to bridge the gap between the humanities and the sciences. At the heart of her mission lies the belief that effective healthcare \"requires the ability to recognize, absorb, interpret, be moved by, and act on the stories of illness.\" Her definitive bookNarrative Medicine: Honoring the Stories of Illnesshas changed the course of uncountable lives, and steers the narrative medicine movement. I first encountered Rita at my orientation to the Narrative Medicine master's program in 2011. She emanated a quiet tenderness as she stepped gently up to the microphone - but soon into her speech she burst forth with impassioned exclamations, rallying the troop of incoming students to her cause to bring together the worlds of healthcare and literary scholarship. As deeply attentive as she is demonstrably passionate, Rita never fails to make an impression. Stories organically unfold when she speaks, on any subject. When we conversed recently, she told me a story that illustrated exactly what narrative medicine is trying to do. This past spring, four second-year medical students were placed under Rita's tutelage. She met with them twice a week for over two hours at a time, observed them interviewing patients and doing physical exams, and carefully read what they wrote about their patients. At the beginning of the semester, they shared with her the first formal written notes for the medical charts of a patient of theirs. One student submitted a summary of a young male patient with HIV, Hepatitis C, and a life-threatening combination of diseases on the AIDS ward - buthowhe wrote it dismayed Rita: \"The first five lines of what he wrote was written almost entirely in abbreviation, with a lot of numbers and percentages. There were barely any words. And this was the opening introduction for anyone who was going to take part in the care of this gentleman, this was the introduction to this gentleman's situation! I got really upset, because the student was being taught - and expected - to write in this telegraphic, reduced, non-linguistic way.\" Rita chuckled as she shared with me the \"slightly snarky\" comment she offered him in response: \"It's a good idea to get in the habit of introducing a description of a patient with some English.\" To her surprise and delight, he really took her suggestion to heart. Several days after offering that comment to the student, she observed him performing a physical exam and interview with a new patient. The patient was a young man with a serious infection and a new cancer, who had previously had initial success with an earlier cancer treatment. But now, he and all the doctors knew that there was nothing more than palliative care to offer him at this point: the cancer could not be reversed or treated. Rita recounted: \"So I'm just sitting, watching. The student invited the patient to tell why he had come to the hospital, what the situation was, and then the patient, very honestly, graphically, without holding back, told the student and me what he was going through in his dying.\" \"He told us about the life he had lived, which had caused his illness. He told us about his heroin use. He told us about his alcoholism. He told us about his promiscuity. He told us about his violent past. He told us about his regrets, for some of the ways he had lived part of his life. He was very, very frank. He said, 'At this point, as I face my dying, I want to do as much as I can to give back.' \"And this student wassohumble, and respectful. The only thing he did as a listener was to remain in the conversation as an active participant. He didn't just sit by passively and let the patient tell whatever he wanted. He was engaged as a listener - he knew how to signal that he was actively listening. Every now and then he would kind of ask a question, to signal that he was actively listening. It was extraordinary. And this was the student who had written those technospeak sentences two days before!\" When Rita and the student spoke afterwards, it became apparent that the significance of the encounter really resonated with him. \"He realized exactly what that patient had given up. He was as moved as was I to hear this open, honest, generous 'Here's what it's like to be dying...' Isn't that something?\" Rita and her student were both left in awe of the \"remarkable, generous donation\" the patient offered by entrusting them with his story. As the student sat at the bedside of the 45-year-old dying with a belly full of cancer, receiving the man's stories, he gave the patient the opportunity to give something back. At the end of the visit, the dying man said: \"I appreciate the opportunity to impart some of what I've learned.\" Rita witnessed how being given the chance to tell his stories \"added some dignity to his life. He was able to give this young, inexperienced medical student some idea of what it's like to be dying.\" Sometimes the seemingly subtle acts of witnessing and sharing story are the most powerful treatments, for both the patient and the physician. Rita Charon, MD, PhD, is Professor of Clinical Medicine and Executive Director of the Program in Narrative Medicine at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. She directs the Humanities and Medicine curriculum for P&S and teaches literature, narrative ethics, and medical interviewing. She also has a primary care practice at Presbyterian Hospital. TEDxAtlanta Talk:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24kHX2HtU3o I have experienced the powerful effect stories have in healing as both a patient and as a caregiver in the role of a full-spectrum doula, which involves supporting women through abortion, miscarriage, and fetal loss. As a graduate of the Narrative Medicine master's program at Columbia University, my driving mission in life is to elicit, honor, and attend to stories. I am the Assistant Director of theCenter for Narrative Practice, which provides people with deep critical training in how stories work and trains them to apply this knowledge to everyday life by using narrative practice, creative arts, and the study of story. I also curate an oral narrative project called \"Inside Stories: Medical Student Experiences\", for which I interview medical students about their experiences in medical school with the intention to provide a platform for their own person healing, self-realization and empowerment through the sharing and receiving of personal stories. I am honored to serve as Program Officer for Health Story Collaborative. As such, I conduct interviews, edit audio stories, and write a blog posts that profile remarkable individuals committed to honoring and making use of stories in health care.

    "data": "It was a humid night in June,One of the hottest days of the year. You could feel your hair standing up on its end,As a cold and warm front collided. It left passers-by wondering if the lightning would ever stop. It did. So people believed that the storm was over,That all was well. I was too loose. A group of us were going to Fenway,First game of the summer,First beer of the week. The change in weather felt like a good omen,We bantered as we walked up to Yawkey,Taking in the smells of Franks,The shouts of vendors,And the sight of RED. As we moved past security,And scalpers that hounded,We made our way to our seats. Suddenly,To the right of me,I heard a sickening sound. Like the thump of a bird as it hits a window,Or the crack of a gun as it soars through the air,Or the split of a head as it meets concrete. A man lay,Cane sprawled in front,Unmoving. RED blood started pooling,Pouring out of both ears,Like my beer pouring out of its tap. People were screaming,But I couldn't hear. I kept thinking,He is right next to me,DO SOMETHING. I thought back to the CPR training I had taken two summers before,Was this it?Is this what I was supposed to do?Is this the final test? I got confused and spun in a circle,Walking around next to him,Hoping that suddenly I would know his diagnosis,As the loops straightened out in my head. Looking,Gaging,Watching,But not acting. THANK GOD. Someone else nudged himSomeone else was on a phone,Someone else said help is on the way. THANK GOD SOMEONE ELSE IS HERE. My friends call me over,Terrified,But they know they are ok. They don't know him,He's not their dad,Uncle,Or brother,But I know him. He was standing right next to ME. Just that morning,I was telling someone about my degree. What do you study?Medical Humanities.What does that mean?EMPATHY.HELP.CARE.LOVE.SUPPORT.Oh ok. I get it. We need more people like that.I AGREE. We need more people like that. NOTRunning away,Waiting for someone else to step in,A FRAUD.A PHONY.A DISGRACE. As the stretcher wheeled itself,And four EMTs rushed after it,I considered chasing after them,I felt sick. I'm sorry man!I didn't know what to do.I'm sorry man!I panicked.I'm sorry man!I've never seen blood pouring out of a brain.I'm sorry man!I haven't signed up for this. But I didn't. Maybe I'm not EMPATHETIC.Maybe I'm not destined to:HELP.CARE.LOVE.SUPPORT.Maybe we need more people like that.I AGREE.

    "data": "By Brian Crouth My memories of boyhood and early teens growing up in the 1960's and early 70's are happy ones. Blessed with loving parents, I am the eldest of seven. Though a household with so many kids was a handful at times, my parents loved having seven children, and as siblings we cherished the moments we shared as one big family. Saturday nights were particularly special: a weekly ritual kicking off with we kids elbow deep in flour and dough for \"make your own pizza\" night followed by all of us gathering around the TV for the CBS lineup of Mary Tyler Moore, Bob Newhart & the Carol Burnett show with paper cups filled with root beer and Bachman pretzel rods for pretend cigars. II One of the high points as a family were our summer vacations with Aunt Mary Jo and Uncle Phil and our younger cousins. In preparation, my mom and aunt would design a menu of entrees they'd cook in advance and freeze. We'd bring ours in a big cooler wedged between suitcases with the nine of us in a station wagon setting off on a 6-8 hour journey to Cape Cod our first two summers and later Rehoboth Beach in Delaware. After long days at the beach marked by tummy surfing on Boogie Boards, picnic lunches, and sunburns, I couldn't wait to run back to our rented cottage to relish the meal to be unveiled that night. All the pre-planning and love that went into the main course - followed by such exotic desserts as freshly baked Congo Bars and crepe night - only added to their deliciousness. The joy and chatter around the dinner table spending time with our favorite relatives we didn't often get a chance to see made it extra special. But the crown jewel for me was the night handpicked by our parents when after dinner we'd get to stroll along the Boardwalk - taking in all of the colorful sights, and music, and aromas with our elders trailing behind. Every summer on Boardwalk night I was a teenager on a mission, perusing the open air storefronts in search of that perfect decal to be ironed on and create my own personalized T-shirt. II One summer around the age of 16, I remember sitting on my beach towel next to the sandy spot that Aunt Mary Jo staked out with an umbrella and picnic blanket. As my cousins ran joyfully in & out of the surf my own joy and enthusiasm I had felt in summers past wasn't there. Rather than sadness, it was as if I felt nothing. I could not understand what was happening to me, or think of any reason why. This same emotional blankness followed me to the other vacation highlights I could always count on for joy and pleasure. But nothing could awaken me from this emotional deadening: not the laughter and cheer around the dinner table, not the Congo bars, not even the Boardwalk. The harder that I - or my parents and aunt and uncle - tried to shake me from this state without success, the more confused and discouraged I felt. The best conclusion any of us could come up with was that I was experiencing the fickleness of adolescence. In actuality, there was a name for this emotional numbness and inability to experience pleasure - Anhedonia - a core characteristic of depression and potent enough to dull the delicious taste of Congo Bars and rob me of my anticipation and joy of Boardwalk night. This would not be the last time I would experience depression. With each episode, however, I soon discovered that a way through and out of the darkness was by writing Poetry. III Though my clearest memory of experiencing depression wasn't until I was 16 I began writing Poetry at a much earlier age. Even then, my first Poems foreshadow someone with a keen sense of sorrow and loss. One of my very first: \"Where Have All My Children Gone.\" was written at the tender age of 12. The Poem imagines what my mother might be feeling after the seven of us had grown, leaving her with an empty nest. To this day, the Poem remains beautiful and poignant, and an audience favorite for my stage readings and podcast. From my earliest Poems unto this day, Poetry has provided a way to chronicle my experiences of depression as well as serve as a means to an eventual breakthrough to free me from its physical and emotional chains. This breakthrough consists of instant insight and clarity coupled with energy and exuberance and an outpouring of creativity in the form of a Poem or Poems - sometimes in a single pen stroke. The Poetry that lifted me out of the darkness however, held its own darker dimension. The span of time from the onset of a depressive episode to a breakthrough involved weeks of psychic suffering and successive nights of sleep deprivation as I pondered in search of an answer. The exhilaration and euphoria of coming out on the other side created its own motive and drive to stay up into the early morning hours, or not sleep at all, to pen the perfect poem that held the holy grail of answers. Unknown to me - or to even my psychotherapists - this was how my own unique form of mania was expressing and cloaking itself. This realization would not arrive until 25 years after my initial experience of depression as a teenager when at the age of 41 the seriousness of an episode required hospitalization and for the first time I was properly diagnosed and treated for depression and mania, commonly referred to as BipolarDisorder. Until then, during that 25 year period between the ages of 16-41 with each depressive episode I hung on to a hope that this breakthrough and Poem that brought me out of darkness and despair would finally hold the answer: putting a halt to my recurring episodes and freeing me from my psychic suffering once and for all. Eventually, I would come to understand that no breakthrough or Poem by itself would ever hold a path to Healing. But before this could happen I would first need to experience the stressors and triggers and depths of illness that awakened the sleeping giant of a major depressive and manic episode. And in that time of need it would have only come with the blessing and good fortune of being admitted to McLean Hospital in Boston - world renown for its patient care and a leader in the field of mental health. And even at McLean it may have never come had I not been placed in the caring and competent hands of a young psychiatrist and Harvard Professor by the name of Dr. Claire Carswell at a monumental time when I never felt so scared, betrayed, and all alone, lost in the unknown of what lie ahead as a psychiatric patient, and fearing that this might mark an end to any hope for an answer to my depression rather than a new beginning. IV Upon admission and observation Dr Carswell immediately determined that what I was experiencing was more than clinical depression. Based on her assessment, she placed me on a medication mix more appropriate for a person suffering from depression AND mania. The fact that I responded immediately and began to stabilize only validated Dr Carswell's hunch that Bipolar Disorder was the correct diagnosis. To this day - almost 20 years later - the same triad of a mood stabilizer, an antidepressant, and a dopamine and serotonin rebalancer that also serves as a sleep aid continues to be my bread and butter medication regimen. After a 10 day period to fully stabilize I transitioned to McLean's Partial Hospital and Intensive Outpatient Care. While receiving the benefit of daily 1-2-1s w/ my mental health coordinator I began attending groups that provided Self-Care essential skills to reduce my vulnerability to depression and mania beginning with a structured sleep routine. As a group we were also taught Dialectical Behavior Therapy or DBT: an array of Distress Tolerance, Interpersonal Effectiveness & Mindfulness skills more akin to going to school for Life 101 than group therapy. Since then, I have been a lifetime learner and practitioner of DBT. This did not mean I would never again find myself in need of a psychiatric setting. When that need arrived it would be Four Winds Hospital an 8 minute drive from where I now live. Four Winds not only offers the same Inpatient, Partial Hospital, and Intensive Outpatient Care as McLean, but the same DBT Skill-based treatment program. Destabilized, in crisis, or in need of reaching out for a higher level of care, the staff at Four Winds always welcome me without judgment chalking up my return visits as an oppty to brush up on my DBT skills. The Monday-Friday 9am-4pm Day program in addition to groups, included an opportunity to have my medications fine tuned - often a contributing factor for destabilizing as well as gentle walks on their peaceful campus, and a group cafeteria lunch break to ensure healthy eating and an opportunity to bond w/ our patient peers & fellow DBT learners. Thus far, it's been 5 years since I sought extra help beyond the outpatient care of a psychiatrist and therapist. And since Bipolar Disorder is an incurable disease, someday I may be knocking on the door of Four Winds once again. And if a need arises: rather than a feeling of failure and shame I'll hold my head up with hope and gratitude. IV Depression and mania never goes away: it's always present and something I'll always struggle with - some days a little more, some days a little less. During those stretches when I'm able to strive and thrive sometimes I even forget I have Bipolar Disorder. But not to worry, depression or mania soon enough will tap me on the shoulder to remind me they're not going anywhere. With each new day my Healing Journey continues to teach me that the rhythmic dance of my depression and mania when tempered by medication, caring and competent professionals, and a lifestyle designed around Self-Care does offer the answer that I had always hoped to find. As for my Poetry, I no longer need to endure extended periods of psychic pain and depriving myself of sleep in a creative frenzy to write a Poem. But there was a time after I was first diagnosed and treated at McLean that the medications required to keep my depression and mania in check also silenced my Poetic Inspiration. And it left me with a decision to make: live w/ untreated Bipolar Disorder choosing misery for the sake of the Muse OR opt for a healthier and happier life - even if it meant I might not ever write Poetry again. Then and now: I choose Life! V Thankfully over time by *Staying faithful to my treatment plan, *Building my knowledge and skills to navigate my illness, and *Uncovering new touch points for Healing and Creativity new pathways have opened to Inspiration and writing Poetry again. This shift has shaped most dramatically in the last seven years when I decided that the safest bet to hedge another major episode and avoid hospitalization was to retire at the age 53 with the help of Social Security Disability. It was time to choose Life once again! VI Yes, a history of mental illness runs on both sides of my family, but so does longevity. And with more room for Self-Care and co-managing my depression and mania, comes more time, energy and opportunities to create a way to share both my Poetry and Healing Story in my podcast: Brian's Poetry Oasis. Through storytelling, music, and Poetry I invite listeners to accompany me on my Healing Journey while offering them their own Moment for Self Care and Healing, thus enabling me to move from Hurting to Healing to Helping. Closing Poem: Who in this room? Who in this room has felt no pain? Who in this room has never suffered? Who in this room walks through life with low self esteem because somehow you feel you deserve to? Who in this room is in such a rush; conditioned since childhood to push, push, push; to chase away fears you can't even name, that tell you, you're never enough? Who in this room has yet to be blessed with the ache of a broken heart, who took a chance to risk it all to find your One True Love? Who in this room this very night will step on to this stage, share all of yourself and hide nothing, unlocking the door of your cage, flying free in a room full of artists and friends who support and encourage, never judge, where together, all of us, create so sacred a space that it feels more like church than church does.

    "data": "Listen to Jessica and Jon share their story. Jessica Peters had a stroke in 2011, at the age of 26, when her left carotid artery spontaneously dissected, or tore, resulting in decreased blood flow to the left side of her brain and permanent damage. She was engaged to be married at the time, and her fiance, Jon, discovered her upon awakening one morning with an asymmetric smile and an inability to speak. Because his mother had had a stroke a year prior, he pretty much knew immediately what was happening. He didn't waste time before calling 911. The stroke hit the left frontal and parietal lobes of the brain, including Broca's area, a region responsible for language production. Now, Jessica lives with persistent weakness in her right arm and leg, as well as an expressive aphasia, meaning she can understand everything that is said to her but has a difficult time producing language, or expressing herself, both in speech and in writing. This can of course be frustrating but she works hard to make herself heard. Jessica and Jon met in 2006, when Jessica was just 22 and Jon was 29. They describe their pre-stroke lives as carefree and playful, full of adventure--amusement parks, rollercoasters, glider rides, concerts, dancing and a lot of laughter. Being physically able and indestructible felt like a given. In addition to her day job as a real estate broker, Jessica, once a roller derby participant herself, worked as a referee for the Boston Derby Dames managing the penalty box. This could get pretty rough, but she thrived on the intensity. The stroke changed things of course, and forced Jon and Jessica to slow down and have a more cautious approach to life, but fun is still a prominent theme in their relationship. Despite the trauma of an unexpected stroke, a grueling recovery and ongoing disability, they continue to laugh as much as possible. Their laughter is buoying. To their credit, they kept their wedding date and were married within a year of the stroke. That was 7 years ago. \"I knew you were still in there,\" says Jon to Jessica. But it hasn't all been easy, and they are honest about their struggles, Jessica more the \"glass-half-full\" type and Jon more of a realist. \"I don't feel why me,\" says Jessica. \"But you did, in the beginning,\" reminds Jon. \"You definitely have an upbeat mentality, but I also observe when you don't. We both have hard times.\" As a couple, they have navigated challenges that would have ended many if not most relationships. Communication has been the biggest struggle, for obvious reasons. According to Jon, it always been important to him to be understood, to process things by talking them through. He acknowledges the sense of loss he feels in this regard, post-stroke. Of course, Jessica wants to be there for Jon and to give him what he needs, but she has some difficulties processing as well as producing language. If she is given too much information all at once, she can't keep track. \"I lose the front words,\" she says. Both acknowledge that the communication challenges have made them more mindful of and sympathetic to what the other needs. Despite, or maybe because of, the struggles, in some ways they now understand each other better. \"I speak Jessica's variety of aphasia,\" says Jon, and indeed, he is an expert at coaxing her along, asking \"Do you want me to tee you up?\" when she gets stuck. And sometimes she tees him up. Their playful banter is practically a dance, stutters and all. Jon calls Jessica \"tough as nails\" and marvels at all she has accomplished. She has demonstrated incredible persistence and has learned to live a full and active life despite her disabilities. \"I don't need your help at all now,\" she reminds Jon, firmly but with a smile. She now volunteers her time to talk with new stroke patients, helping them adjust to their post-stroke lives. She reminds them to hold on to hope, to keep moving forward. For Jessica, life is good. She's married, has a job, owns a house, and plays adaptive sports--rock climbing, biking, kayaking. Most importantly, she and Jon have a thriving and happy relationship. The stroke has required both of them to redefine themselves again and again. This is not the life they planned for, but they're doing it, living fully, listening to one another, being honest and laughing whenever possible. *Mixing and sound design byDavid Goodman Music: Joa Rajadel, \"The Quiet Mind's Essence\" (2019 CC-by, nd, nc) FMT (Marco Fabre), \"Project 3612\" (2019 CC-by, nd, nc) Guitario, \"Temps Perdu\" (2019 CC-by, nd, nc) Oto Yumeno, \"Lover's Ballad\" (2019 CC-by, nd, nc) Joystock, \"Majestic Earth\" (2019 CC-by, nd, nc)",
